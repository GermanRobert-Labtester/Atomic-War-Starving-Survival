# Plan 173 — Shelter Radio Production & Audience Response — Residual Plan

> Integration plan revision: 2026-09-24. Source of truth: current repository source and data, then
AGENTS.md, then
[docs/newest-ashfall-master-expansion-authority-v2-0-complete-compiled-edition-volumes-1-57.md](../docs/newest-ashfall-master-expansion-authority-v2-0-complete-compiled-edition-volumes-1-57.md).
This document is a planning artifact. It does not claim paths or authorize a competing implementation
package.

## 1. Objective and bounded outcome

Trace one delivered program from scheduled airtime through persisted audience response and one canonical
morale or follow-up consumer, while keeping production, station schedule, PsyOps, and radio signal
authorities separate.

**Current state:** LIVE: two authored programs, job prep/cancel/delivery, phase-4 daily tick, save section,
host session, RadioPanel binding, and Core audience calculation already exist. The September stub is stale;
remaining work is the unbound audience callbacks, presenter capability source, production follow-up route,
and truthful effect presentation.

**Non-goals:** No replacement radio station scheduler, no invented presenter skills, no new signal
scenarios, no second PsyOps campaign ledger, no panel-generated audience values, no duplicate delivery on
reload.

**First deliverable:** one vertical slice with a real producer fact, one canonical destination owner,
save/reload parity, and a truthful player readout. Later slices are separate claims and must repeat the
premise check.

## 2. Authority and evidence status

The current or candidate domain authority is `RadioProgramProductionSystem for jobs and audience facts;
Radio schedule for airtime, PsyOps for campaigns, morale/standing owners for effects`. Source and adjacent
paths inspected for this revision (some are candidate consumers rather than active bindings):
`Assets/Ashfall.Core/Radio/RadioProgramProductionSystem.cs`,
`src/Host/RadioProgramProductionHostSession.cs`, `src/Main.RadioProgramProduction.cs`,
`src/Host/RadioProgramProductionSaveStore.cs`, `src/UI/RadioPanel.cs`, and
`Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/radio_programs.json`. The focused test starting point is
`Ashfall.Core.Tests/Radio/Plan173RadioProgramProductionTests.cs`. Persistence boundary under audit:
`radio_program_production section`. Paths are evidence pointers, not advance claims.
The master expansion authority v2.0 supplies the planning discipline and continuity map: DM-8/C8 records the
live radio program host and catalog; F-05 requires authored transcript material to remain subordinate to
live program semantics. Distress content and availability routes have sealed or retired constraints. Its
Part II requires live premise checks, bounded subject scope, explicit evidence labels, and a duplication
firewall. The relevant deep maps and lane matrices guide coverage; they do not override newer code. The
master compilation itself warns against padding and stale repository assumptions. This plan therefore
records concrete contracts and treats older task lists as intent pending current verification.

## 3. Current contract and collision firewall

- **Evidence or explicit premise:** Main.SetupRadioProgramProduction loads radio_programs.json and restores
  the radio_program_production section.
- **Evidence or explicit premise:** Main.TickRadioProgramProduction advances prep, then asks
  ScheduleCoordinator.Resolve for ready jobs at their bound station frequency.
- **Evidence or explicit premise:** RadioProgramProductionSystem.TryDeliver rejects no transmission, jam,
  silence, station mismatch, and non-ready jobs.
- **Evidence or explicit premise:** CalculateAudienceResponse computes genre morale, presenter capability,
  reach grade and opportunity; target faction remains empty in the observed path.
- **Evidence or explicit premise:** Core offers ApplyShelterMoraleDelta and ApplyFactionReputationDelta
  callbacks and ResolveFollowUpHook; the observed src search found no bindings for these callbacks or a
player caller of ResolveFollowUpHook.
- **Evidence or explicit premise:** RadioPanel binds the production session, while a separate follow-up
  strip reads radio signal follow-ups; distinguish these from production job hooks.

### Radio production contract dossier

The start path checks a template, station/slot, equipment, and prep cost before creating a stable job ID.
The host supplies inventory delegates. Audit the order of cost consumption versus all remaining validation
so a late refusal cannot spend an item. The day owner advances prep and asks the radio schedule for a
concrete broadcast fact; delivery must not synthesize airtime from a successful job. Store job status,
source broadcast ID, audience result, and follow-up identity through the existing section.

`CalculateAudienceResponse` computes `MoraleDelta`, `ReachGrade`, `OpportunityCreated`, target faction, and
faction reputation delta. In the observed method, target faction is initialized empty and never set; no
faction standing effect should be advertised until a target source and one-authority bridge are approved.
The morale callback exists, but no src binding was found in this audit; an approved host adapter must bind
it before any UI or journal claim says morale changed. Opportunities are a boolean in the job; an actual
quest or encounter requires a named
destination owner and authored ID.

`ResolveFollowUpHook` records a resolution action inside Core. Its action vocabulary, legality, and
downstream consumer need a specific command route. The `RadioPanel` follow-up strip currently displays
signal-follow-up state from `_radioHost`, which is not automatically the production follow-up ledger. A UI
addition must label each origin and show unresolved production hooks from `GetUnresolvedFollowUps`, with
close/back/focus parity and no side effects during refresh.

The master authority's radio transcript ambitions are content expansions. A two-template catalog does not
justify inventing a new signal scenario. Any additional transcript must bind to a verified template and
broadcast route and respect the sealed distress contract.

Before code edits, inspect existing equivalent producers and consumers with `rg`, read their public methods
and save snapshots, and write a one-page premise note. If another live owner already mutates the target
concern, use it. If a required write API does not exist, return the proposed consumer hook to the foreman as
an authority decision. Do not create a side ledger to bypass that missing API.

## 4. Ownership matrix

| Concern | Current or proposed owner | Implementation rule |
|---|---|---|
| authored definitions | `Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/radio_programs.json` | Validate schema, IDs, references and finite ranges before use. |
| source fact | `Assets/Ashfall.Core/Radio/RadioProgramProductionSystem.cs` | Keep domain invariants in Core; source emits a typed fact. |
| host composition | `src/Host/RadioProgramProductionHostSession.cs` | Wire only current owners and lifetime-safe event subscriptions. |
| campaign save | `radio_program_production section` | Use the existing section or seek an explicit section decision if none exists. |
| player view | `src/UI/RadioPanel.cs` | Render current state, blockers and effects without gameplay mutation. |
| cross-system effect | `destination subsystem named in each phase` | Call the owner method once; do not copy its mutable state. |

## 5. Data and identity contract

Canonical IDs come from the existing catalogs and runtime facts. Case handling, trimming and comparison must
match the owning system. Proposed new IDs need a schema and reference validator before a producer can emit
them. Read the current JSON fields before extending a row; do not use the old plan’s desired row count as an
acceptance measure. Reject duplicates or conflicting definitions with per-row diagnostics. Treat display
names and prose as presentation, never identity. Preserve ordinal ordering for stable output and save
checksum inputs.
A change to catalog shape requires an old-catalog compatibility rule, one example valid row, one invalid
row, and a reader inventory. New prose must state a real observed consequence; it cannot promise trade,
safety, quest or reward behavior until a consumer reads the corresponding Core fact. Avoid real-world names
or copied narrative.

## 6. C# implementation sketch

```csharp
// Existing Core path; host supplies the schedule fact, Core owns job transition.
var result = production.TryDeliver(jobId, scheduledBroadcast, day);
// Only after a successful transition may an approved adapter commit response
// to the canonical morale owner and mark that application durable.
// ResolveFollowUpHook is a distinct player command, never panel refresh work.
```

The snippet shows ownership and call direction, not a paste-ready replacement. The implementing agent must
confirm names and signatures against the live tree immediately before coding. Keep `Assets/Ashfall.Core/`
free of Godot and Unity references. If an adapter needs a callback, bind it in the current host lifetime,
unsubscribe on disposal, and keep domain decisions in Core.

## 7. State, save and migration

Inspect `src/Host/RadioProgramProductionSaveStore.cs` and the registry for the named concern; absence of a
section is a decision gate, not permission to invent one. Write down exact DTO version, constructor
baseline, capture point, restore point, and dirty flag. For a stateless bridge, persist only the source and
destination authorities; do not create a bridge section. If a new mutable field is genuinely required,
version the existing owner DTO and prove migration from the preceding schema. Never equate a panel cache
with campaign state.
The restore sequence is: catalog validated; source state restored; destination state restored; adapters
bound; pending effects reconciled once; UI bound; day processing resumes. A new campaign starts with an
explicit empty/default state. A legacy save without the field takes that same baseline without inventing
past events. Unknown future schema versions must fail or degrade according to the existing save contract,
with a visible diagnostic. Corrupt single records must not silently reset an entire unrelated section.

## 8. Event, day and failure semantics

One semantic fact should carry stable source ID, campaign day, owning entity ID, content ID if any, and
enough context for the destination owner to decide. The host may route the fact but may not calculate a
competing gameplay rule. Define when the fact is emitted, when a command is committed, and what is durable
before the next callback. A read-only query must not create journal entries or rewards on every panel
refresh.
Use the canonical day owner only for behavior that genuinely changes with time. Preserve the current day
phase ordering and forked seeded RNG contract. No wall-clock seed, hash-order iteration, or System.Random
belongs in deterministic Core. Replay after load must not repeat a completed effect; an effect that was not
committed must remain recoverable. When a destination owner rejects a command, keep the source fact and show
a reason rather than writing a partial substitute effect.

## 9. Player commands and UI

Inspect the current route to `src/UI/RadioPanel.cs` and its bind/open/close methods. Expose only commands
backed by an existing Core method or a specifically planned method in the named owner. The panel should show
source state, currently legal action, expected cost, blocker, committed outcome, and uncertainty where the
game cannot know more. Refresh on authoritative state change and after restore; unbind subscriptions on
close/disposal. Preserve keyboard/controller back and readable contrast.

## 10. Dependency-ordered implementation phases

### Phase 0 — Premise and claim

**Action:** Read current source/data; diff the old plan against delivered work; claim exact paths before an
edit. **Gate:** A signed package lists files, owner, non-goals, acceptance and focused command.
**Dependency:** Phase 0 requires a claim; later phases require the preceding gate. Shared composition roots
remain integrator-owned; if a phase needs them, package the exact seam for the integrator.

### Phase 1 — Core/consumer contract

**Action:** Identify one producer fact and one destination owner. Add the smallest typed query or command if
the owner agrees. **Gate:** A domain unit exercise proves input, refusal, and stable identity.
**Dependency:** Phase 0 requires a claim; later phases require the preceding gate. Shared composition roots
remain integrator-owned; if a phase needs them, package the exact seam for the integrator.

### Phase 2 — Data validation

**Action:** Extend only the existing catalog as required by Phase 1; validate references and ranges.
**Gate:** One valid and one invalid row produce clear, reproducible results. **Dependency:** Phase 0
requires a claim; later phases require the preceding gate. Shared composition roots remain integrator-owned;
if a phase needs them, package the exact seam for the integrator.

### Phase 3 — Save and restore

**Action:** Bind existing section; introduce versioned state only for genuinely new durable facts. **Gate:**
Round-trip, old-save baseline, and replay-after-restore agree. **Dependency:** Phase 0 requires a claim;
later phases require the preceding gate. Shared composition roots remain integrator-owned; if a phase needs
them, package the exact seam for the integrator.

### Phase 4 — Host composition

**Action:** Bind in the current session at correct setup order, route result to destination owner once.
**Gate:** A focused host-level check observes the real destination effect. **Dependency:** Phase 0 requires
a claim; later phases require the preceding gate. Shared composition roots remain integrator-owned; if a
phase needs them, package the exact seam for the integrator.

### Phase 5 — UI and narrative

**Action:** Bind existing panel or claimed route to a read model; show action and blocker truthfully.
**Gate:** A headless or bounded runtime check opens/refreshes/closes without a stale claim. **Dependency:**
Phase 0 requires a claim; later phases require the preceding gate. Shared composition roots remain
integrator-owned; if a phase needs them, package the exact seam for the integrator.

### Phase 6 — Acceptance and handoff

**Action:** Run only directly affected focused test files and necessary runtime probe. **Gate:** Handoff
includes exact commands/results, limitations, and shared paths untouched. **Dependency:** Phase 0 requires a
claim; later phases require the preceding gate. Shared composition roots remain integrator-owned; if a phase
needs them, package the exact seam for the integrator.

## 11. File impact map

| Path | Action after claim | Reason | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Assets/Ashfall.Core/Radio/RadioProgramProductionSystem.cs` | READ / bounded MODIFY | domain contract | medium |
| `Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/radio_programs.json` | READ / bounded MODIFY | authored rules | medium |
| `src/Host/RadioProgramProductionHostSession.cs` | READ / bounded MODIFY | session wiring | high |
| `src/Main.RadioProgramProduction.cs` | READ / integrator MODIFY | composition root | high |
| `src/Host/RadioProgramProductionSaveStore.cs` | READ / bounded MODIFY | persistence | high |
| `src/UI/RadioPanel.cs` | READ / bounded MODIFY | truthful surface | medium |
| `Ashfall.Core.Tests/Radio/Plan173RadioProgramProductionTests.cs` | READ / focused MODIFY | contract verification | low |

No paths in this table are claimed by this document. At implementation time compare them with
`WORKTREE_OWNERSHIP.md` and assign the exact package. Do not edit a currently claimed path.

## 12. Focused acceptance and rollback

Use `bash scripts/run_test.sh Ashfall.Core.Tests/Radio/Plan173RadioProgramProductionTests.cs` for the first
contract check, then only the directly affected save and host targets identified by Phase 0. Run a Godot
headless probe only if the claimed change affects the runtime host path. A compile result cannot establish
live route reachability. Acceptance requires: (1) one real input; (2) one canonical consumer effect; (3) one
durable restore; (4) repeat delivery without duplicate effect; (5) visible correct state and blocker; (6) no
new authority.
Keep changes in reviewable phase commits. If a consumer hook fails, revert that phase without replacing the
canonical owner; preserve old saves and catalog compatibility. If a migrated section cannot load, stop
before adding UI or content and give the integrator the exact schema and fixture. Record any deferred edge
with a current evidence pointer and promotion condition rather than claiming it complete.

## 13. Detailed integration acceptance cards

The following cards are planning checks, not a request to create one test method per card. Each card has one
feature-specific expected outcome; crosscutting checks below it define the evidence needed to accept that
outcome. Select the smallest independent cases that prove the changed contract, save/load, determinism,
lifecycle, and cross-system behavior. “Legacy intent” cards are explicitly conditional: first prove their
premise and owner, then either promote as a separate bounded package or mark them retired. This prevents the
2026-09-01 plan text from resurrecting already delivered or contradictory architecture.

### 01. morning bulletin template [CURRENT ACCEPTANCE SCENARIO — VERIFY EFFECT]

**Source and ownership:** This card concerns morning bulletin template. Start from
`Assets/Ashfall.Core/Radio/RadioProgramProductionSystem.cs` and
`Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/radio_programs.json` and trace any effect through
`src/Host/RadioProgramProductionHostSession.cs` to its current destination owner. Persistence must follow
this boundary: `radio_program_production section`. Verify the exact source and destination sections; a new
section requires an ownership decision. Keep the source fact distinct from the consumer mutation. Catalog
evidence: No catalog row directly matches this integration case; verify the current producer and destination
API before implementation.

**Feature-specific acceptance:** radio_prog_shelter_morning_bulletin resolves its authored station and slot,
starts one prep job and uses its actual civilian_news response.

**Fresh campaign path.** For morning bulletin template, Start a new seeded campaign with the smallest legal
source fact. Invoke the current owner through its normal host entry point, then inspect the projected
outcome at the intended consumer. State the exact identifier and day in the focused fixture. The card passes
only when the named destination read model or canonical command has the expected result; otherwise record a
bounded dependency. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination
state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Repeat and idempotency.** For morning bulletin template, Deliver the same source fact twice, including a
retry after a UI refresh or host rebind. The owner must use its existing stable ID or an explicitly designed
applied marker so the consumer mutation and player notification occur once. Do not solve duplication by a
process-local boolean that disappears on reload. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable
ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Save and restore.** For morning bulletin template, Capture the relevant existing section after the source
fact and before the player views it. Restore into a fresh host/session and compare domain state, consumer
state, and visible text. Repeat with the save taken immediately before the consumer effect to prove the
recovery path has an explicit pending/completed contract. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method,
stable ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Invalid reference.** For morning bulletin template, Replace one referenced catalog ID with an unresolved
value in an isolated fixture. The data validator should report the authored error; runtime must refuse that
one effect or show a specific unavailable reason. It must not invent a fallback faction, location, survivor,
item, quest, or animal. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day,
destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Day/order boundary.** For morning bulletin template, Exercise the same fact at day 1, at the relevant
threshold, and after a later day tick. Run setup in both legal host orders if the dependency may initialize
lazily. The final state must follow canonical campaign day and deterministic ordering, with no callback
registered twice. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination
state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Player surface.** For morning bulletin template, Open the existing panel before and after the effect and
after reloading. The panel reads a Core or host read model, displays the actual blocker and outcome, and
preserves close/back/focus behavior. A label that announces a benefit absent from the owning system fails
this card. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination state field
or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Cross-owner consequence.** For morning bulletin template, Trace the fact from producer to destination
authority. Show the precise command/query on the destination owner, the one save section it already uses,
and a visible downstream difference. If no such command exists, record the need as a named integration
dependency rather than writing state into the producer. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method,
stable ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Determinism and bounds.** For morning bulletin template, Replay identical seed, content and ordered facts
in two fresh runs; compare the existing section state and consumer read model. Clamp only at the owner that
defines the allowed range. If this card needs randomness, fork from the existing campaign stream and make
the event key stable. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination
state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Focused selection:** Reuse `Ashfall.Core.Tests/Radio/Plan173RadioProgramProductionTests.cs` if it covers
this contract. Add a case only for a new public, save, lifecycle, mutation, deterministic, or cross-owner
behavior. Record this card as passed, deferred with an owner, or stale with source evidence; do not leave an
ambiguous “implemented” label.

### 02. evening story template [CURRENT ACCEPTANCE SCENARIO — VERIFY EFFECT]

**Source and ownership:** This card concerns evening story template. Start from
`Assets/Ashfall.Core/Radio/RadioProgramProductionSystem.cs` and
`Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/radio_programs.json` and trace any effect through
`src/Host/RadioProgramProductionHostSession.cs` to its current destination owner. Persistence must follow
this boundary: `radio_program_production section`. Verify the exact source and destination sections; a new
section requires an ownership decision. Keep the source fact distinct from the consumer mutation. Catalog
evidence: No catalog row directly matches this integration case; verify the current producer and destination
API before implementation.

**Feature-specific acceptance:** radio_prog_classroom_evening_story starts from its authored slot and yields
its storytelling response only after a real broadcast.

**Fresh campaign path.** For evening story template, Start a new seeded campaign with the smallest legal
source fact. Invoke the current owner through its normal host entry point, then inspect the projected
outcome at the intended consumer. State the exact identifier and day in the focused fixture. The card passes
only when the named destination read model or canonical command has the expected result; otherwise record a
bounded dependency. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination
state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Repeat and idempotency.** For evening story template, Deliver the same source fact twice, including a
retry after a UI refresh or host rebind. The owner must use its existing stable ID or an explicitly designed
applied marker so the consumer mutation and player notification occur once. Do not solve duplication by a
process-local boolean that disappears on reload. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable
ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Save and restore.** For evening story template, Capture the relevant existing section after the source
fact and before the player views it. Restore into a fresh host/session and compare domain state, consumer
state, and visible text. Repeat with the save taken immediately before the consumer effect to prove the
recovery path has an explicit pending/completed contract. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method,
stable ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Invalid reference.** For evening story template, Replace one referenced catalog ID with an unresolved
value in an isolated fixture. The data validator should report the authored error; runtime must refuse that
one effect or show a specific unavailable reason. It must not invent a fallback faction, location, survivor,
item, quest, or animal. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day,
destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Day/order boundary.** For evening story template, Exercise the same fact at day 1, at the relevant
threshold, and after a later day tick. Run setup in both legal host orders if the dependency may initialize
lazily. The final state must follow canonical campaign day and deterministic ordering, with no callback
registered twice. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination
state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Player surface.** For evening story template, Open the existing panel before and after the effect and
after reloading. The panel reads a Core or host read model, displays the actual blocker and outcome, and
preserves close/back/focus behavior. A label that announces a benefit absent from the owning system fails
this card. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination state field
or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Cross-owner consequence.** For evening story template, Trace the fact from producer to destination
authority. Show the precise command/query on the destination owner, the one save section it already uses,
and a visible downstream difference. If no such command exists, record the need as a named integration
dependency rather than writing state into the producer. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method,
stable ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Determinism and bounds.** For evening story template, Replay identical seed, content and ordered facts in
two fresh runs; compare the existing section state and consumer read model. Clamp only at the owner that
defines the allowed range. If this card needs randomness, fork from the existing campaign stream and make
the event key stable. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination
state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Focused selection:** Reuse `Ashfall.Core.Tests/Radio/Plan173RadioProgramProductionTests.cs` if it covers
this contract. Add a case only for a new public, save, lifecycle, mutation, deterministic, or cross-owner
behavior. Record this card as passed, deferred with an owner, or stale with source evidence; do not leave an
ambiguous “implemented” label.

### 03. unknown template refusal [CURRENT ACCEPTANCE SCENARIO — VERIFY EFFECT]

**Source and ownership:** This card concerns unknown template refusal. Start from
`Assets/Ashfall.Core/Radio/RadioProgramProductionSystem.cs` and
`Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/radio_programs.json` and trace any effect through
`src/Host/RadioProgramProductionHostSession.cs` to its current destination owner. Persistence must follow
this boundary: `radio_program_production section`. Verify the exact source and destination sections; a new
section requires an ownership decision. Keep the source fact distinct from the consumer mutation. Catalog
evidence: No catalog row directly matches this integration case; verify the current producer and destination
API before implementation.

**Feature-specific acceptance:** StartPrep with an unknown template returns unknown_template before any
equipment or cost mutation.

**Fresh campaign path.** For unknown template refusal, Start a new seeded campaign with the smallest legal
source fact. Invoke the current owner through its normal host entry point, then inspect the projected
outcome at the intended consumer. State the exact identifier and day in the focused fixture. The card passes
only when the named destination read model or canonical command has the expected result; otherwise record a
bounded dependency. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination
state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Repeat and idempotency.** For unknown template refusal, Deliver the same source fact twice, including a
retry after a UI refresh or host rebind. The owner must use its existing stable ID or an explicitly designed
applied marker so the consumer mutation and player notification occur once. Do not solve duplication by a
process-local boolean that disappears on reload. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable
ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Save and restore.** For unknown template refusal, Capture the relevant existing section after the source
fact and before the player views it. Restore into a fresh host/session and compare domain state, consumer
state, and visible text. Repeat with the save taken immediately before the consumer effect to prove the
recovery path has an explicit pending/completed contract. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method,
stable ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Invalid reference.** For unknown template refusal, Replace one referenced catalog ID with an unresolved
value in an isolated fixture. The data validator should report the authored error; runtime must refuse that
one effect or show a specific unavailable reason. It must not invent a fallback faction, location, survivor,
item, quest, or animal. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day,
destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Day/order boundary.** For unknown template refusal, Exercise the same fact at day 1, at the relevant
threshold, and after a later day tick. Run setup in both legal host orders if the dependency may initialize
lazily. The final state must follow canonical campaign day and deterministic ordering, with no callback
registered twice. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination
state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Player surface.** For unknown template refusal, Open the existing panel before and after the effect and
after reloading. The panel reads a Core or host read model, displays the actual blocker and outcome, and
preserves close/back/focus behavior. A label that announces a benefit absent from the owning system fails
this card. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination state field
or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Cross-owner consequence.** For unknown template refusal, Trace the fact from producer to destination
authority. Show the precise command/query on the destination owner, the one save section it already uses,
and a visible downstream difference. If no such command exists, record the need as a named integration
dependency rather than writing state into the producer. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method,
stable ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Determinism and bounds.** For unknown template refusal, Replay identical seed, content and ordered facts
in two fresh runs; compare the existing section state and consumer read model. Clamp only at the owner that
defines the allowed range. If this card needs randomness, fork from the existing campaign stream and make
the event key stable. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination
state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Focused selection:** Reuse `Ashfall.Core.Tests/Radio/Plan173RadioProgramProductionTests.cs` if it covers
this contract. Add a case only for a new public, save, lifecycle, mutation, deterministic, or cross-owner
behavior. Record this card as passed, deferred with an owner, or stale with source evidence; do not leave an
ambiguous “implemented” label.

### 04. required station slot [CURRENT ACCEPTANCE SCENARIO — VERIFY EFFECT]

**Source and ownership:** This card concerns required station slot. Start from
`Assets/Ashfall.Core/Radio/RadioProgramProductionSystem.cs` and
`Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/radio_programs.json` and trace any effect through
`src/Host/RadioProgramProductionHostSession.cs` to its current destination owner. Persistence must follow
this boundary: `radio_program_production section`. Verify the exact source and destination sections; a new
section requires an ownership decision. Keep the source fact distinct from the consumer mutation. Catalog
evidence: No catalog row directly matches this integration case; verify the current producer and destination
API before implementation.

**Feature-specific acceptance:** SlotExists must validate the chosen station/slot pair; a missing authored
slot blocks prep.

**Fresh campaign path.** For required station slot, Start a new seeded campaign with the smallest legal
source fact. Invoke the current owner through its normal host entry point, then inspect the projected
outcome at the intended consumer. State the exact identifier and day in the focused fixture. The card passes
only when the named destination read model or canonical command has the expected result; otherwise record a
bounded dependency. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination
state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Repeat and idempotency.** For required station slot, Deliver the same source fact twice, including a retry
after a UI refresh or host rebind. The owner must use its existing stable ID or an explicitly designed
applied marker so the consumer mutation and player notification occur once. Do not solve duplication by a
process-local boolean that disappears on reload. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable
ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Save and restore.** For required station slot, Capture the relevant existing section after the source fact
and before the player views it. Restore into a fresh host/session and compare domain state, consumer state,
and visible text. Repeat with the save taken immediately before the consumer effect to prove the recovery
path has an explicit pending/completed contract. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable
ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Invalid reference.** For required station slot, Replace one referenced catalog ID with an unresolved value
in an isolated fixture. The data validator should report the authored error; runtime must refuse that one
effect or show a specific unavailable reason. It must not invent a fallback faction, location, survivor,
item, quest, or animal. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day,
destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Day/order boundary.** For required station slot, Exercise the same fact at day 1, at the relevant
threshold, and after a later day tick. Run setup in both legal host orders if the dependency may initialize
lazily. The final state must follow canonical campaign day and deterministic ordering, with no callback
registered twice. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination
state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Player surface.** For required station slot, Open the existing panel before and after the effect and after
reloading. The panel reads a Core or host read model, displays the actual blocker and outcome, and preserves
close/back/focus behavior. A label that announces a benefit absent from the owning system fails this card.
Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination state field or read
model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Cross-owner consequence.** For required station slot, Trace the fact from producer to destination
authority. Show the precise command/query on the destination owner, the one save section it already uses,
and a visible downstream difference. If no such command exists, record the need as a named integration
dependency rather than writing state into the producer. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method,
stable ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Determinism and bounds.** For required station slot, Replay identical seed, content and ordered facts in
two fresh runs; compare the existing section state and consumer read model. Clamp only at the owner that
defines the allowed range. If this card needs randomness, fork from the existing campaign stream and make
the event key stable. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination
state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Focused selection:** Reuse `Ashfall.Core.Tests/Radio/Plan173RadioProgramProductionTests.cs` if it covers
this contract. Add a case only for a new public, save, lifecycle, mutation, deterministic, or cross-owner
behavior. Record this card as passed, deferred with an owner, or stale with source evidence; do not leave an
ambiguous “implemented” label.

### 05. required equipment [CURRENT ACCEPTANCE SCENARIO — VERIFY EFFECT]

**Source and ownership:** This card concerns required equipment. Start from
`Assets/Ashfall.Core/Radio/RadioProgramProductionSystem.cs` and
`Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/radio_programs.json` and trace any effect through
`src/Host/RadioProgramProductionHostSession.cs` to its current destination owner. Persistence must follow
this boundary: `radio_program_production section`. Verify the exact source and destination sections; a new
section requires an ownership decision. Keep the source fact distinct from the consumer mutation. Catalog
evidence: No catalog row directly matches this integration case; verify the current producer and destination
API before implementation.

**Feature-specific acceptance:** An unavailable required_equipment_item_id yields missing_equipment and
leaves prep cost untouched.

**Fresh campaign path.** For required equipment, Start a new seeded campaign with the smallest legal source
fact. Invoke the current owner through its normal host entry point, then inspect the projected outcome at
the intended consumer. State the exact identifier and day in the focused fixture. The card passes only when
the named destination read model or canonical command has the expected result; otherwise record a bounded
dependency. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination state
field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Repeat and idempotency.** For required equipment, Deliver the same source fact twice, including a retry
after a UI refresh or host rebind. The owner must use its existing stable ID or an explicitly designed
applied marker so the consumer mutation and player notification occur once. Do not solve duplication by a
process-local boolean that disappears on reload. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable
ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Save and restore.** For required equipment, Capture the relevant existing section after the source fact
and before the player views it. Restore into a fresh host/session and compare domain state, consumer state,
and visible text. Repeat with the save taken immediately before the consumer effect to prove the recovery
path has an explicit pending/completed contract. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable
ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Invalid reference.** For required equipment, Replace one referenced catalog ID with an unresolved value in
an isolated fixture. The data validator should report the authored error; runtime must refuse that one
effect or show a specific unavailable reason. It must not invent a fallback faction, location, survivor,
item, quest, or animal. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day,
destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Day/order boundary.** For required equipment, Exercise the same fact at day 1, at the relevant threshold,
and after a later day tick. Run setup in both legal host orders if the dependency may initialize lazily. The
final state must follow canonical campaign day and deterministic ordering, with no callback registered
twice. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination state field or
read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Player surface.** For required equipment, Open the existing panel before and after the effect and after
reloading. The panel reads a Core or host read model, displays the actual blocker and outcome, and preserves
close/back/focus behavior. A label that announces a benefit absent from the owning system fails this card.
Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination state field or read
model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Cross-owner consequence.** For required equipment, Trace the fact from producer to destination authority.
Show the precise command/query on the destination owner, the one save section it already uses, and a visible
downstream difference. If no such command exists, record the need as a named integration dependency rather
than writing state into the producer. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source
day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Determinism and bounds.** For required equipment, Replay identical seed, content and ordered facts in two
fresh runs; compare the existing section state and consumer read model. Clamp only at the owner that defines
the allowed range. If this card needs randomness, fork from the existing campaign stream and make the event
key stable. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination state
field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Focused selection:** Reuse `Ashfall.Core.Tests/Radio/Plan173RadioProgramProductionTests.cs` if it covers

behavior. Record this card as passed, deferred with an owner, or stale with source evidence; do not leave an
ambiguous “implemented” label.

### 06. prep cost consumption [CURRENT ACCEPTANCE SCENARIO — VERIFY EFFECT]

**Source and ownership:** This card concerns prep cost consumption. Start from
`Assets/Ashfall.Core/Radio/RadioProgramProductionSystem.cs` and
`Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/radio_programs.json` and trace any effect through
`src/Host/RadioProgramProductionHostSession.cs` to its current destination owner. Persistence must follow
this boundary: `radio_program_production section`. Verify the exact source and destination sections; a new
section requires an ownership decision. Keep the source fact distinct from the consumer mutation. Catalog
evidence: No catalog row directly matches this integration case; verify the current producer and destination
API before implementation.

**Feature-specific acceptance:** An insufficient prep_cost_item_id yields missing_prep_cost; a successful
start consumes the catalog count exactly once.

**Fresh campaign path.** For prep cost consumption, Start a new seeded campaign with the smallest legal
source fact. Invoke the current owner through its normal host entry point, then inspect the projected
outcome at the intended consumer. State the exact identifier and day in the focused fixture. The card passes
only when the named destination read model or canonical command has the expected result; otherwise record a
bounded dependency. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination
state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

process-local boolean that disappears on reload. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable
ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Save and restore.** For prep cost consumption, Capture the relevant existing section after the source fact
and before the player views it. Restore into a fresh host/session and compare domain state, consumer state,
and visible text. Repeat with the save taken immediately before the consumer effect to prove the recovery
path has an explicit pending/completed contract. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable
ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is

behavior. Record this card as passed, deferred with an owner, or stale with source evidence; do not leave an
ambiguous “implemented” label.

### 07. presenter capability source [CURRENT ACCEPTANCE SCENARIO — VERIFY EFFECT]

**Source and ownership:** This card concerns presenter capability source. Start from
`Assets/Ashfall.Core/Radio/RadioProgramProductionSystem.cs` and
`Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/radio_programs.json` and trace any effect through
`src/Host/RadioProgramProductionHostSession.cs` to its current destination owner. Persistence must follow
this boundary: `radio_program_production section`. Verify the exact source and destination sections; a new
section requires an ownership decision. Keep the source fact distinct from the consumer mutation. Catalog
evidence: No catalog row directly matches this integration case; verify the current producer and destination
API before implementation.

**Feature-specific acceptance:** PresenterCapabilityProvider must read a real presenter record or use the
documented neutral 1.0 fallback; retired presenter-skills work stays closed.

**Fresh campaign path.** For presenter capability source, Start a new seeded campaign with the smallest
legal source fact. Invoke the current owner through its normal host entry point, then inspect the projected
outcome at the intended consumer. State the exact identifier and day in the focused fixture. The card passes
only when the named destination read model or canonical command has the expected result; otherwise record a
bounded dependency. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination
state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Repeat and idempotency.** For presenter capability source, Deliver the same source fact twice, including a
retry after a UI refresh or host rebind. The owner must use its existing stable ID or an explicitly designed
applied marker so the consumer mutation and player notification occur once. Do not solve duplication by a
process-local boolean that disappears on reload. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable
ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Save and restore.** For presenter capability source, Capture the relevant existing section after the
source fact and before the player views it. Restore into a fresh host/session and compare domain state,
consumer state, and visible text. Repeat with the save taken immediately before the consumer effect to prove
the recovery path has an explicit pending/completed contract. Acceptance evidence should name the actual
method, stable ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the
operation is unavailable.

**Invalid reference.** For presenter capability source, Replace one referenced catalog ID with an unresolved
value in an isolated fixture. The data validator should report the authored error; runtime must refuse that
one effect or show a specific unavailable reason. It must not invent a fallback faction, location, survivor,

### 08. duplicate active job [CURRENT ACCEPTANCE SCENARIO — VERIFY EFFECT]

**Source and ownership:** This card concerns duplicate active job. Start from
`Assets/Ashfall.Core/Radio/RadioProgramProductionSystem.cs` and
`Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/radio_programs.json` and trace any effect through
`src/Host/RadioProgramProductionHostSession.cs` to its current destination owner. Persistence must follow

**Player surface.** For cancel terminal job refusal, Open the existing panel before and after the effect and
after reloading. The panel reads a Core or host read model, displays the actual blocker and outcome, and
preserves close/back/focus behavior. A label that announces a benefit absent from the owning system fails
this card. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination state field
or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Cross-owner consequence.** For cancel terminal job refusal, Trace the fact from producer to destination
authority. Show the precise command/query on the destination owner, the one save section it already uses,
and a visible downstream difference. If no such command exists, record the need as a named integration
dependency rather than writing state into the producer. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method,
stable ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Determinism and bounds.** For cancel terminal job refusal, Replay identical seed, content and ordered
facts in two fresh runs; compare the existing section state and consumer read model. Clamp only at the owner
that defines the allowed range. If this card needs randomness, fork from the existing campaign stream and
make the event key stable. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day,
destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Focused selection:** Reuse `Ashfall.Core.Tests/Radio/Plan173RadioProgramProductionTests.cs` if it covers
this contract. Add a case only for a new public, save, lifecycle, mutation, deterministic, or cross-owner
behavior. Record this card as passed, deferred with an owner, or stale with source evidence; do not leave an
ambiguous “implemented” label.

### 12. successful scheduled delivery [CURRENT ACCEPTANCE SCENARIO — VERIFY EFFECT]

**Source and ownership:** This card concerns successful scheduled delivery. Start from
`Assets/Ashfall.Core/Radio/RadioProgramProductionSystem.cs` and
`Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/radio_programs.json` and trace any effect through
`src/Host/RadioProgramProductionHostSession.cs` to its current destination owner. Persistence must follow
this boundary: `radio_program_production section`. Verify the exact source and destination sections; a new
section requires an ownership decision. Keep the source fact distinct from the consumer mutation. Catalog
evidence: No catalog row directly matches this integration case; verify the current producer and destination
API before implementation.

**Feature-specific acceptance:** TryDeliver accepts a ScheduleCoordinator.Resolve fact for the job station
and stores LastDeliveryBroadcastId once.

**Fresh campaign path.** For successful scheduled delivery, Start a new seeded campaign with the smallest
legal source fact. Invoke the current owner through its normal host entry point, then inspect the projected
outcome at the intended consumer. State the exact identifier and day in the focused fixture. The card passes
only when the named destination read model or canonical command has the expected result; otherwise record a
bounded dependency. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination
state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Repeat and idempotency.** For successful scheduled delivery, Deliver the same source fact twice, including
a retry after a UI refresh or host rebind. The owner must use its existing stable ID or an explicitly
designed applied marker so the consumer mutation and player notification occur once. Do not solve
duplication by a process-local boolean that disappears on reload. Acceptance evidence should name the actual
method, stable ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the
operation is unavailable.

**Save and restore.** For successful scheduled delivery, Capture the relevant existing section after the
source fact and before the player views it. Restore into a fresh host/session and compare domain state,
consumer state, and visible text. Repeat with the save taken immediately before the consumer effect to prove
the recovery path has an explicit pending/completed contract. Acceptance evidence should name the actual
method, stable ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the
operation is unavailable.

**Invalid reference.** For successful scheduled delivery, Replace one referenced catalog ID with an
unresolved value in an isolated fixture. The data validator should report the authored error; runtime must
refuse that one effect or show a specific unavailable reason. It must not invent a fallback faction,
location, survivor, item, quest, or animal. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID,
source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Day/order boundary.** For successful scheduled delivery, Exercise the same fact at day 1, at the relevant
threshold, and after a later day tick. Run setup in both legal host orders if the dependency may initialize
lazily. The final state must follow canonical campaign day and deterministic ordering, with no callback
registered twice. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination
state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Player surface.** For successful scheduled delivery, Open the existing panel before and after the effect
and after reloading. The panel reads a Core or host read model, displays the actual blocker and outcome, and

this card. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination state field
or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Cross-owner consequence.** For successful scheduled delivery, Trace the fact from producer to destination

ambiguous “implemented” label.

### 13. jammed or silent delivery [CURRENT ACCEPTANCE SCENARIO — VERIFY EFFECT]

**Source and ownership:** This card concerns jammed or silent delivery. Start from
`Assets/Ashfall.Core/Radio/RadioProgramProductionSystem.cs` and
`Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/radio_programs.json` and trace any effect through
`src/Host/RadioProgramProductionHostSession.cs` to its current destination owner. Persistence must follow
this boundary: `radio_program_production section`. Verify the exact source and destination sections; a new
section requires an ownership decision. Keep the source fact distinct from the consumer mutation. Catalog
evidence: No catalog row directly matches this integration case; verify the current producer and destination
API before implementation.

**Feature-specific acceptance:** Jammed, silent or absent transmission returns the corresponding failure
code and keeps the job Ready for a later valid fact.

**Fresh campaign path.** For jammed or silent delivery, Start a new seeded campaign with the smallest legal
source fact. Invoke the current owner through its normal host entry point, then inspect the projected
outcome at the intended consumer. State the exact identifier and day in the focused fixture. The card passes
only when the named destination read model or canonical command has the expected result; otherwise record a
bounded dependency. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination
state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Repeat and idempotency.** For jammed or silent delivery, Deliver the same source fact twice, including a
retry after a UI refresh or host rebind. The owner must use its existing stable ID or an explicitly designed
applied marker so the consumer mutation and player notification occur once. Do not solve duplication by a
process-local boolean that disappears on reload. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable
ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Save and restore.** For jammed or silent delivery, Capture the relevant existing section after the source
fact and before the player views it. Restore into a fresh host/session and compare domain state, consumer
state, and visible text. Repeat with the save taken immediately before the consumer effect to prove the
recovery path has an explicit pending/completed contract. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method,
stable ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Invalid reference.** For jammed or silent delivery, Replace one referenced catalog ID with an unresolved

this card. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination state field
or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

dependency rather than writing state into the producer. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method,
stable ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Determinism and bounds.** For jammed or silent delivery, Replay identical seed, content and ordered facts
in two fresh runs; compare the existing section state and consumer read model. Clamp only at the owner that
defines the allowed range. If this card needs randomness, fork from the existing campaign stream and make
the event key stable. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination

behavior. Record this card as passed, deferred with an owner, or stale with source evidence; do not leave an
ambiguous “implemented” label.

### 14. station mismatch [CURRENT ACCEPTANCE SCENARIO — VERIFY EFFECT]

**Source and ownership:** This card concerns station mismatch. Start from
`Assets/Ashfall.Core/Radio/RadioProgramProductionSystem.cs` and
`Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/radio_programs.json` and trace any effect through
`src/Host/RadioProgramProductionHostSession.cs` to its current destination owner. Persistence must follow
this boundary: `radio_program_production section`. Verify the exact source and destination sections; a new
section requires an ownership decision. Keep the source fact distinct from the consumer mutation. Catalog
evidence: No catalog row directly matches this integration case; verify the current producer and destination
API before implementation.

**Feature-specific acceptance:** A broadcast for a different StationId returns station_mismatch and does not
start PsyOps or apply audience response.

**Fresh campaign path.** For station mismatch, Start a new seeded campaign with the smallest legal source
fact. Invoke the current owner through its normal host entry point, then inspect the projected outcome at
the intended consumer. State the exact identifier and day in the focused fixture. The card passes only when
the named destination read model or canonical command has the expected result; otherwise record a bounded
dependency. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination state
field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Repeat and idempotency.** For station mismatch, Deliver the same source fact twice, including a retry
after a UI refresh or host rebind. The owner must use its existing stable ID or an explicitly designed
applied marker so the consumer mutation and player notification occur once. Do not solve duplication by a
process-local boolean that disappears on reload. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable
ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Save and restore.** For station mismatch, Capture the relevant existing section after the source fact and
before the player views it. Restore into a fresh host/session and compare domain state, consumer state, and
visible text. Repeat with the save taken immediately before the consumer effect to prove the recovery path
has an explicit pending/completed contract. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID,
source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Invalid reference.** For station mismatch, Replace one referenced catalog ID with an unresolved value in
an isolated fixture. The data validator should report the authored error; runtime must refuse that one

**Day/order boundary.** For station mismatch, Exercise the same fact at day 1, at the relevant threshold,
and after a later day tick. Run setup in both legal host orders if the dependency may initialize lazily. The
final state must follow canonical campaign day and deterministic ordering, with no callback registered
twice. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination state field or
read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Player surface.** For station mismatch, Open the existing panel before and after the effect and after
reloading. The panel reads a Core or host read model, displays the actual blocker and outcome, and preserves
close/back/focus behavior. A label that announces a benefit absent from the owning system fails this card.
Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination state field or read
model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Cross-owner consequence.** For station mismatch, Trace the fact from producer to destination authority.
Show the precise command/query on the destination owner, the one save section it already uses, and a visible
downstream difference. If no such command exists, record the need as a named integration dependency rather
than writing state into the producer. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source
day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Determinism and bounds.** For station mismatch, Replay identical seed, content and ordered facts in two
fresh runs; compare the existing section state and consumer read model. Clamp only at the owner that defines
the allowed range. If this card needs randomness, fork from the existing campaign stream and make the event
key stable. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination state

### 15. audience morale delta owner [CURRENT ACCEPTANCE SCENARIO — VERIFY EFFECT]

**Source and ownership:** This card concerns audience morale delta owner. Start from
`Assets/Ashfall.Core/Radio/RadioProgramProductionSystem.cs` and
`Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/radio_programs.json` and trace any effect through
`src/Host/RadioProgramProductionHostSession.cs` to its current destination owner. Persistence must follow
this boundary: `radio_program_production section`. Verify the exact source and destination sections; a new
section requires an ownership decision. Keep the source fact distinct from the consumer mutation. Catalog
evidence: No catalog row directly matches this integration case; verify the current producer and destination
API before implementation.

**Feature-specific acceptance:** For a delivered job, inspect ApplyShelterMoraleDelta binding and compare
canonical morale before/after; a stored delta alone is not a morale effect.

**Fresh campaign path.** For audience morale delta owner, Start a new seeded campaign with the smallest
legal source fact. Invoke the current owner through its normal host entry point, then inspect the projected
outcome at the intended consumer. State the exact identifier and day in the focused fixture. The card passes
only when the named destination read model or canonical command has the expected result; otherwise record a
bounded dependency. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination
state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Repeat and idempotency.** For audience morale delta owner, Deliver the same source fact twice, including a
retry after a UI refresh or host rebind. The owner must use its existing stable ID or an explicitly designed

process-local boolean that disappears on reload. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable
ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Save and restore.** For audience morale delta owner, Capture the relevant existing section after the
source fact and before the player views it. Restore into a fresh host/session and compare domain state,
consumer state, and visible text. Repeat with the save taken immediately before the consumer effect to prove
the recovery path has an explicit pending/completed contract. Acceptance evidence should name the actual
method, stable ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the
operation is unavailable.

**Invalid reference.** For audience morale delta owner, Replace one referenced catalog ID with an unresolved
value in an isolated fixture. The data validator should report the authored error; runtime must refuse that
one effect or show a specific unavailable reason. It must not invent a fallback faction, location, survivor,

**Player surface.** For audience morale delta owner, Open the existing panel before and after the effect and
after reloading. The panel reads a Core or host read model, displays the actual blocker and outcome, and
preserves close/back/focus behavior. A label that announces a benefit absent from the owning system fails
this card. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination state field
or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

behavior. Record this card as passed, deferred with an owner, or stale with source evidence; do not leave an
ambiguous “implemented” label.

### 16. reach grade and signal strength [CURRENT ACCEPTANCE SCENARIO — VERIFY EFFECT]

**Source and ownership:** This card concerns reach grade and signal strength. Start from
`Assets/Ashfall.Core/Radio/RadioProgramProductionSystem.cs` and
`Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/radio_programs.json` and trace any effect through
`src/Host/RadioProgramProductionHostSession.cs` to its current destination owner. Persistence must follow
this boundary: `radio_program_production section`. Verify the exact source and destination sections; a new
section requires an ownership decision. Keep the source fact distinct from the consumer mutation. Catalog
evidence: No catalog row directly matches this integration case; verify the current producer and destination
API before implementation.

**Feature-specific acceptance:** SignalStrength below 5, at 5 and at 8 yields the observed
Local/District/Regional grades; opportunity uses its separate >=6 threshold.

**Fresh campaign path.** For reach grade and signal strength, Start a new seeded campaign with the smallest
legal source fact. Invoke the current owner through its normal host entry point, then inspect the projected
outcome at the intended consumer. State the exact identifier and day in the focused fixture. The card passes
only when the named destination read model or canonical command has the expected result; otherwise record a
bounded dependency. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination
state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Repeat and idempotency.** For reach grade and signal strength, Deliver the same source fact twice,
including a retry after a UI refresh or host rebind. The owner must use its existing stable ID or an
explicitly designed applied marker so the consumer mutation and player notification occur once. Do not solve
duplication by a process-local boolean that disappears on reload. Acceptance evidence should name the actual
method, stable ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the
operation is unavailable.

**Save and restore.** For reach grade and signal strength, Capture the relevant existing section after the
source fact and before the player views it. Restore into a fresh host/session and compare domain state,
consumer state, and visible text. Repeat with the save taken immediately before the consumer effect to prove
the recovery path has an explicit pending/completed contract. Acceptance evidence should name the actual

section requires an ownership decision. Keep the source fact distinct from the consumer mutation. Catalog
evidence: No catalog row directly matches this integration case; verify the current producer and destination
API before implementation.

**Feature-specific acceptance:** CalculateAudienceResponse currently leaves TargetFactionId empty; no
standing mutation is accepted without an authored target and one owner.

**Fresh campaign path.** For faction reputation target absence, Start a new seeded campaign with the
smallest legal source fact. Invoke the current owner through its normal host entry point, then inspect the
projected outcome at the intended consumer. State the exact identifier and day in the focused fixture. The
card passes only when the named destination read model or canonical command has the expected result;
otherwise record a bounded dependency. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source
day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Repeat and idempotency.** For faction reputation target absence, Deliver the same source fact twice,
including a retry after a UI refresh or host rebind. The owner must use its existing stable ID or an

**Player surface.** For faction reputation target absence, Open the existing panel before and after the
effect and after reloading. The panel reads a Core or host read model, displays the actual blocker and
outcome, and preserves close/back/focus behavior. A label that announces a benefit absent from the owning
system fails this card. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day,
destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Cross-owner consequence.** For faction reputation target absence, Trace the fact from producer to

section requires an ownership decision. Keep the source fact distinct from the consumer mutation. Catalog
evidence: No catalog row directly matches this integration case; verify the current producer and destination
API before implementation.

**Feature-specific acceptance:** StartPropagandaCampaign delegates once to PsyOps after successful delivery
and records PropagandaStarted truthfully.

**Fresh campaign path.** For PsyOps campaign handoff, Start a new seeded campaign with the smallest legal
source fact. Invoke the current owner through its normal host entry point, then inspect the projected
outcome at the intended consumer. State the exact identifier and day in the focused fixture. The card passes
only when the named destination read model or canonical command has the expected result; otherwise record a
bounded dependency. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination
state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Repeat and idempotency.** For PsyOps campaign handoff, Deliver the same source fact twice, including a
retry after a UI refresh or host rebind. The owner must use its existing stable ID or an explicitly designed
applied marker so the consumer mutation and player notification occur once. Do not solve duplication by a
process-local boolean that disappears on reload. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable
ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Save and restore.** For PsyOps campaign handoff, Capture the relevant existing section after the source
fact and before the player views it. Restore into a fresh host/session and compare domain state, consumer
state, and visible text. Repeat with the save taken immediately before the consumer effect to prove the
recovery path has an explicit pending/completed contract. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method,
stable ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Invalid reference.** For PsyOps campaign handoff, Replace one referenced catalog ID with an unresolved
value in an isolated fixture. The data validator should report the authored error; runtime must refuse that
one effect or show a specific unavailable reason. It must not invent a fallback faction, location, survivor,
item, quest, or animal. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day,
destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Day/order boundary.** For PsyOps campaign handoff, Exercise the same fact at day 1, at the relevant
threshold, and after a later day tick. Run setup in both legal host orders if the dependency may initialize
lazily. The final state must follow canonical campaign day and deterministic ordering, with no callback
registered twice. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination
state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Player surface.** For PsyOps campaign handoff, Open the existing panel before and after the effect and
after reloading. The panel reads a Core or host read model, displays the actual blocker and outcome, and
preserves close/back/focus behavior. A label that announces a benefit absent from the owning system fails
this card. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination state field
or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Cross-owner consequence.** For PsyOps campaign handoff, Trace the fact from producer to destination
authority. Show the precise command/query on the destination owner, the one save section it already uses,
and a visible downstream difference. If no such command exists, record the need as a named integration
dependency rather than writing state into the producer. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method,
stable ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Determinism and bounds.** For PsyOps campaign handoff, Replay identical seed, content and ordered facts in
two fresh runs; compare the existing section state and consumer read model. Clamp only at the owner that
defines the allowed range. If this card needs randomness, fork from the existing campaign stream and make
the event key stable. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination
state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Focused selection:** Reuse `Ashfall.Core.Tests/Radio/Plan173RadioProgramProductionTests.cs` if it covers
this contract. Add a case only for a new public, save, lifecycle, mutation, deterministic, or cross-owner
behavior. Record this card as passed, deferred with an owner, or stale with source evidence; do not leave an
ambiguous “implemented” label.

### 19. production follow-up resolution [CURRENT ACCEPTANCE SCENARIO — VERIFY EFFECT]

**Source and ownership:** This card concerns production follow-up resolution. Start from
`Assets/Ashfall.Core/Radio/RadioProgramProductionSystem.cs` and
`Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/radio_programs.json` and trace any effect through
`src/Host/RadioProgramProductionHostSession.cs` to its current destination owner. Persistence must follow
this boundary: `radio_program_production section`. Verify the exact source and destination sections; a new
section requires an ownership decision. Keep the source fact distinct from the consumer mutation. Catalog
evidence: No catalog row directly matches this integration case; verify the current producer and destination
API before implementation.

**Feature-specific acceptance:** GetUnresolvedFollowUps shows followup_{jobId}; ResolveFollowUpHook accepts
a signed action vocabulary and persists resolved day once.

**Fresh campaign path.** For production follow-up resolution, Start a new seeded campaign with the smallest
legal source fact. Invoke the current owner through its normal host entry point, then inspect the projected
outcome at the intended consumer. State the exact identifier and day in the focused fixture. The card passes
only when the named destination read model or canonical command has the expected result; otherwise record a
bounded dependency. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination
state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Repeat and idempotency.** For production follow-up resolution, Deliver the same source fact twice,
including a retry after a UI refresh or host rebind. The owner must use its existing stable ID or an
explicitly designed applied marker so the consumer mutation and player notification occur once. Do not solve
duplication by a process-local boolean that disappears on reload. Acceptance evidence should name the actual
method, stable ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the
operation is unavailable.

**Save and restore.** For production follow-up resolution, Capture the relevant existing section after the
source fact and before the player views it. Restore into a fresh host/session and compare domain state,
consumer state, and visible text. Repeat with the save taken immediately before the consumer effect to prove
the recovery path has an explicit pending/completed contract. Acceptance evidence should name the actual
method, stable ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the
operation is unavailable.

**Invalid reference.** For production follow-up resolution, Replace one referenced catalog ID with an
unresolved value in an isolated fixture. The data validator should report the authored error; runtime must
refuse that one effect or show a specific unavailable reason. It must not invent a fallback faction,
location, survivor, item, quest, or animal. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID,
source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Day/order boundary.** For production follow-up resolution, Exercise the same fact at day 1, at the
relevant threshold, and after a later day tick. Run setup in both legal host orders if the dependency may

### 20. save/load and re-delivery parity [CURRENT ACCEPTANCE SCENARIO — VERIFY EFFECT]

**Source and ownership:** This card concerns save/load and re-delivery parity. Start from
`Assets/Ashfall.Core/Radio/RadioProgramProductionSystem.cs` and
`Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/radio_programs.json` and trace any effect through
`src/Host/RadioProgramProductionHostSession.cs` to its current destination owner. Persistence must follow
this boundary: `radio_program_production section`. Verify the exact source and destination sections; a new
section requires an ownership decision. Keep the source fact distinct from the consumer mutation. Catalog
evidence: No catalog row directly matches this integration case; verify the current producer and destination
API before implementation.

**Feature-specific acceptance:** Restore a Ready and a Delivered job into a fresh host; the former may
deliver once, the latter never replays morale or PsyOps.

**Fresh campaign path.** For save/load and re-delivery parity, Start a new seeded campaign with the smallest
legal source fact. Invoke the current owner through its normal host entry point, then inspect the projected
outcome at the intended consumer. State the exact identifier and day in the focused fixture. The card passes
only when the named destination read model or canonical command has the expected result; otherwise record a

## 15. Handoff contract

**MUST PRESERVE:** one Core/domain owner per concern, current JSON authority, existing save lineage,
deterministic replay, and claimed-path discipline.

**MUST ADD:** only the scoped producer-to-consumer path and its observable result after the Phase 0 premise
audit.

**MUST NOT ADD:** a parallel registry, default fake facts, unowned UI mutation, duplicate resource, morale,
dose, archive, achievement, profile, or faction state, Unity dependency, or a full-suite gate for this
document edit.

**VERIFY WITH:** `bash scripts/run_test.sh Ashfall.Core.Tests/Radio/Plan173RadioProgramProductionTests.cs`
plus targeted owner save/host checks selected at claim time under `TEST_POLICY.md`.

**FIRST SAFE IMPLEMENTATION STEP:** publish a current premise note and exact path claim, then implement the
first accepted vertical slice. This plan does not itself alter production code.
