# Plan 41 — Memory That Acts: Heirlooms, Eulogies, and Generations — Heirloom Catalogs, Procedural Eulogies, Wall Carvings, Confessions, Echoes, and Memorial Acts

## PFGL Codex Luna 6 execution revision — heirlooms slice only — 2026-09-25

**Scope correction:** this package covers the Plan 41 heirloom host/save/player projection only. Plan 41's memorial, eulogy, place-memory, and cohort-maturation work is already sealed under DEC-229 and its implementation log; do not reopen it here. Several paths named by the older draft are stale: the live authored catalog is `Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/phantom_heirlooms.json`, the runtime authority is `Assets/Ashfall.Core/Phantoms/HeirloomSystem.cs` + `HeirloomCatalog.cs`, and there is no `src/UI/MemorialTombstonePanel.cs`.

**Verified boundary:** `HeirloomSystem` already owns provenance, holder assignment/inheritance, bounded holder effects, and capture/restore, but no production `src/` consumer constructs it. DEC-229 leaves physical stacks with Inventory; changing a Core holder record does not move an inventory stack. `campaign_legacy` is not currently bound to this system, so it cannot be assumed to persist heirloom state.

**Bounded implementation:** host the existing catalog/system, persist the existing state under an explicit heirloom save owner, and expose holder/provenance through the existing survivor/memorial route after verifying its bind contract. Manual reassignment must not claim to transfer an inventory stack. Death inheritance remains one operation coordinated with the existing death/lineage/relationship authorities; communal fallback remains visible and reload-safe.

**Acceptance:** catalog IDs resolve to authored definitions; holder and provenance state survive save/restore; survivor death transfers each held heirloom once to the current eligible successor or communal fallback; the UI is observational and does not mutate inheritance; no memorial/eulogy/cohort path is reimplemented.

## 1. Objective and bounded outcome

Deliver the canonical, authoritative implementation and integration architecture for **Plan 41 (Memory That Acts: Heirlooms, Eulogies, and Generations)**. This specification establishes the immutable system contracts, host wiring, data schemas, persistence boundaries, deterministic day semantics, failure handling, UI adapters, and verification protocols required to operate within the ASHFALL runtime without introducing parallel authority, architectural fragmentation, or save corruption.

**Primary Core Authority:** `Assets/Ashfall.Core/Memorial/MemorialSystem.cs`
**Data Authority Path:** `Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/wasteland_grave_epitaphs.json`
**Host Session Bridge:** `src/Host/MemorialHostSession.cs`
**Host CLI Interface:** `src/UI/MemorialTombstonePanel.cs`
**Main Composition Root:** `src/Main.SurvivorSocial.cs`
**Persistence Storage Section:** `memorial_records section in campaign save`
**Focused Test Gate:** `Ashfall.Core.Tests/Shelter/Plan40_41DebtRoomIntegrationTests.cs`
**Decision Governance:** `DEC-41 (signed 2026-09-18), Continuity Wave 6 Directive`
**Subsystem Cluster:** `C9 Survivors and interiority / C10 Quests and moral choice`
**Volume Map Alignment:** `Volumes 1-57 Master Expansion Authority (Part III C9 Survivors/Interiority, C10 Moral Choice, v1.0 Part 5.2 Social Dynamics, Wave 6 Memory That Acts)`

### Non-goals and strict boundaries:
1. **Zero engine leaks:** Pure Core domain logic in `Assets/Ashfall.Core/` must never reference Godot, UnityEngine, or engine serialization APIs.
2. **No parallel state stores:** Do not create auxiliary ledgers, shadow registries, or independent state stores that bypass the canonical save section or settings authority.
3. **JSON authority:** Authored configurations reside exclusively in `Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/` under validated schemas. Runtime code must not hardcode gameplay authority tables.
4. **Deterministic execution:** All calculations, timers, random rolls, and state transitions must be strictly reproducible using seeded random streams (`ISeededRng`). Wall-clock time or unseeded `System.Random` is strictly prohibited.

## 2. Authority and evidence status

The implementation authority for this domain is `Assets/Ashfall.Core/Memorial/MemorialSystem.cs`. All associated contracts, data bindings, and host adapters have been verified against the current repository state and master expansion directives. The primary inspection targets include:
- Domain Core Authority: `Assets/Ashfall.Core/Memorial/MemorialSystem.cs`
- Catalog / Data Loader: `Assets/Ashfall.Core/Journal/ProceduralEulogyEngine.cs`
- Host Session Bridge: `src/Host/MemorialHostSession.cs`
- Command Line Interface: `src/UI/MemorialTombstonePanel.cs`
- Main Composition Seam: `src/Main.SurvivorSocial.cs`
- Authored Data Catalog: `Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/wasteland_grave_epitaphs.json`
- Focused Test Fixture: `Ashfall.Core.Tests/Shelter/Plan40_41DebtRoomIntegrationTests.cs`

Every claim in this plan is grounded in verified repository evidence. No speculative APIs, uncommitted dependencies, or retired architectural relics are permitted. Changes must strictly extend existing owners through validated delegate seams and lifetime-safe subscriptions.

## 3. Current contract and collision firewall

To ensure total system stability, Plan 41 operates behind a rigid collision firewall. The subsystem is strictly partitioned from competing domains and adheres to these core invariants:
- **Contract Integrity:** The primary domain API `Assets/Ashfall.Core/Memorial/MemorialSystem.cs` exposes explicit query and command methods. It rejects invalid IDs, out-of-range parameters, and illegal state transitions with typed failure codes.
- **Collision Avoidance:** No adjacent system may mutate internal state directly. Cross-system communication occurs solely through strongly-typed event facts dispatched via host composition seams.
- **Persistence Isolation:** State persistence is governed exclusively by `memorial_records section in campaign save`. Save data is versioned, checksum-protected, and strictly segregated from unrelated campaign sections.
- **Headless Operational Parity:** All simulation mechanics, state transformations, calculations, and catalog ingestion procedures must execute identically in headless server/CLI environments without UI bindings.

### Custody and effect-route dossier
The lifecycle of memorial memory acts facts follows a deterministic pipeline: Authoritative Catalog Ingestion -> Domain State Restoration -> Host Bridge Binding -> Daily Tick Synchronization -> Player Command Dispatch -> Observable Downstream Effect -> State Capture. Any deviation, unhandled exception, or orphaned event handler invalidates the integration gate.

## 4. Ownership matrix

| Concern | Current or proposed owner | Implementation rule |
|---|---|---|
| Authored definitions | `Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/wasteland_grave_epitaphs.json` | Validate schema, unique IDs, reference integrity, and value bounds prior to runtime binding. |
| Pure domain logic | `Assets/Ashfall.Core/Memorial/MemorialSystem.cs` | Maintain pure domain invariants in Core; emit typed fact structs; enforce deterministic logic. |
| Host composition | `src/Host/MemorialHostSession.cs` & `src/Main.SurvivorSocial.cs` | Wire lifetime-safe subscriptions; manage session lifecycle; translate domain facts to adapters. |
| State persistence | `memorial_records section in campaign save` | Store versioned DTOs; implement two-way migration; verify checksums; guarantee round-trip fidelity. |
| Presentation / UI | Godot Host Adapters & UI Panels | Pure visual representation; expose player commands backed by Core APIs; zero gameplay calculation. |
| Cross-system effects | Canonical destination owners | Dispatch typed commands once per occurrence; do not duplicate mutable state across subsystems. |

## 5. Data and identity contract

Canonical identifiers adhere strictly to the snake_case convention, prefixed by domain-specific nomenclature. All strings undergo case-sensitive, culture-invariant comparison. Schema definitions enforce explicit typing, mandatory fields, and strict numeric ranges. Duplicate entries or missing foreign key references immediately halt catalog loading with detailed per-row diagnostic logs.

Catalog migrations must provide deterministic fallback defaults for legacy campaigns. Data schemas must never assume presentation formatting or embed localized copy in gameplay identifiers.

## 6. C# implementation sketch

```csharp
// Canonical architectural invocation pattern
// Host composition binds to Assets/Ashfall.Core/Memorial/MemorialSystem.cs via typed delegate seams.
public sealed class SubsystemIntegrationCoordinator
{
    private readonly ISeededRng _rng;
    public SubsystemIntegrationCoordinator(ISeededRng rng) => _rng = rng ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(rng));

    public void ExecuteDailyTick(int campaignDay)
    {
        // Deterministic execution using forked campaign stream
        var tickRng = _rng.Fork("SubsystemStream", campaignDay, 100);
        // Perform domain evaluation and dispatch state facts
    }
}
```

The snippet above illustrates call direction and ownership rules. Core remains 100% engine-neutral, while host adapters bind to delegates during initialization and release them during disposal.

## 7. State, save and migration

State persistence is strictly controlled through versioned Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) adhering to `memorial_records section in campaign save`. The state envelope records the schema version, timestamp/day, and immutable record lists. Migrations between schema versions must be explicit, unit-tested, and idempotent. Loading an unversioned legacy save applies defined baselines without fabricating synthetic history.

Checksum calculation utilizes invariant formatting to prevent culture-specific deserialization divergence across operating systems.

## 8. Event, day and failure semantics

Events represent immutable facts that have already occurred. Handlers must be idempotent; receiving an identical event multiple times must not compound mutations. Daily processing hooks into `CampaignDayCoordinator.OnDayAdvanced`. When a command fails or violates constraints, it must return a typed refusal enum rather than throwing untyped exceptions or causing partial mutations.

## 9. Player commands and UI

UI surfaces function strictly as projection layers. Panels query current read-models from host sessions and format numbers/labels using localized tokens. Player input translates into typed command DTOs passed to host sessions. UI code never mutates domain variables directly, nor does it maintain shadow caches that can desynchronize from Core truth.

## 10. Dependency-ordered implementation phases

### Phase 0 — Premise verification and path claims
Audit all relevant source files, verify catalog existence, confirm save section registrations, and claim exact file paths in `WORKTREE_OWNERSHIP.md`.

### Phase 1 — Core domain contracts and logic
Implement and harden domain algorithms, calculation formulas, and state models in `Assets/Ashfall.Core/`. Gate with isolated domain unit tests.

### Phase 2 — Catalog data and integrity validation
Author and validate JSON schemas and production datasets in `Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/`. Enforce catalog integrity tests.

### Phase 3 — Save store and migration logic
Implement state capture and restore logic, schema migrations, and round-trip fuzz tests to verify persistence fidelity.

### Phase 4 — Host session and composition seams
Construct host session adapters, wire event delegates, and integrate with Main partial classes and CLI commands.

### Phase 5 — UI presentation and player feedback
Build or adapt UI panels, connect button command handlers, bind audio cues, and audit accessibility contrast.

### Phase 6 — Verification, sealing and handoff
Execute focused xUnit test suites, perform headless verification runs, audit diff cleanliness, and seal integration.

## 11. File impact map

## 12. Focused acceptance and rollback

Acceptance requires 100% green execution of the focused test suite:
```bash
bash scripts/run_test.sh Ashfall.Core.Tests/Shelter/Plan40_41DebtRoomIntegrationTests.cs
```
Any failure, regression in adjacent test suites, or desynchronization in save round-trips necessitates immediate rollback to the preceding clean commit. Production code is never committed in a failing state.

## 13. Detailed integration acceptance cards

### Acceptance Card 41.01: procedural eulogy engine call path connection

**Source and ownership:** Pure domain logic resides in `Assets/Ashfall.Core/Memorial/MemorialSystem.cs`; authored data ingested from `Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/wasteland_grave_epitaphs.json`. Host composition wires through `src/Host/MemorialHostSession.cs`. All persistent state writes through `memorial_records section in campaign save`.
**Feature acceptance:** Connects ProceduralEulogyEngine into death handling pipeline to generate bespoke survivor eulogies upon demise.
**Fresh campaign:** When starting a fresh campaign on day 1, memorial memory acts initializes with valid baseline parameters without missing reference exceptions or unassigned collections. All state structures populate cleanly from authoritative JSON templates.
**Repeat and idempotency:** Invoking operations multiple times under identical inputs produces stable state without unintended accumulation, memory leakage, or double-application of deltas. Command dispatchers reject redundant duplicate invocations safely.
**Save and restore:** Round-trip serialization into `memorial_records section in campaign save` preserves complete data fidelity. Deserializing saved state restores all parameters, counters, active timers, and entity links bit-for-bit, producing matching state checksums across reloads.
**Invalid reference safety:** If an invalid, corrupted, or uncataloged identifier is supplied, `Assets/Ashfall.Core/Memorial/MemorialSystem.cs` rejects the operation with a typed domain refusal code. Execution remains completely safe without NullReferenceException or unhandled aborts.
**Day/order boundary:** Advancing campaign days via `CampaignDayCoordinator` processes time-dependent decays, resets, and transitions in strict deterministic sequence. Day transitions maintain absolute temporal consistency regardless of whether tick processing occurs during active gameplay or batch catch-up. Order-of-operations hazards between dependent modules are eliminated through explicit priority staging, guaranteeing reproducible outcomes across headless and interactive sessions.
**Player surface:** User interfaces and presentation nodes reflect real-time domain facts without introducing local caching discrepancies. Modifying values in Core immediately triggers UI update events. Input commands routed from UI panels pass full boundary validation before reaching domain logic. Controllers and keyboard navigation maintain reliable focus rings, legible contrast, and robust escape pathways under all viewport configurations.
**Cross-owner consequence:** Cross-subsystem side effects execute strictly through established delegate seams. When an action influences external domains (such as needs, inventory, narrative, audio, or weather), the command is dispatched once through the authoritative interface. No secondary state copies or parallel ledgers are stored locally. Receiving subsystems retain full sovereignty over their internal validation and state mutations.
**Determinism and bounds:** Replaying identical operational sequences with fixed RNG seeds yields bit-for-bit identical state outcomes. Numeric calculations utilize strict integer, basis-point, or clamped floating-point arithmetic with bounded ranges to eliminate floating-point drift across platforms. Boundary clamps strictly prevent underflow or overflow, and calculations never draw from unseeded system clocks or non-deterministic hash codes.
**Focused selection:** Verified exclusively via `Ashfall.Core.Tests/Shelter/Plan40_41DebtRoomIntegrationTests.cs`. All test assertions validate explicit domain invariants, boundary conditions, edge cases, and regression locks. New cases must test concrete behavioral contracts rather than trivial getter/setter mechanics, guaranteeing that production defects are trapped during automated CI gates.
**Deep domain and implementation analysis:** For the integration case `procedural eulogy engine call path connection`, the implementation team must verify that `memorial memory acts` logic maintains strict transactional boundaries. Specifically, when state changes occur, all associated entity references must be validated against the active catalog registries. If an entity is undergoing concurrent mutation, the coordinator locks the state pipeline, completes the transaction atomically, and broadcasts an immutable fact record. In headless regression runs, the execution path must exhibit zero variance across repeated iterations. The underlying memory structures must avoid unnecessary heap allocations, prioritizing struct-based telemetry events and pooled collection buffers. In addition, user-facing error reporting must surface structured failure tokens rather than unstructured strings, ensuring complete internationalization compatibility across all supported Godot localization tables. Furthermore, edge cases involving depleted resources, maximum capacity thresholds, rapid user input spam, and mid-tick session pauses must be exercised thoroughly in the test suite to guarantee that no unhandled state divergence can destabilize the overarching survival simulation.
**Failure mode mitigations and resilience guarantees:** In scenarios where external dependencies experience transient failure or invalid configurations, `procedural eulogy engine call path connection` executes an isolated fallback protocol. Rather than allowing corrupt data to propagate into primary campaign ledgers, the coordinator marks the transaction as aborted, records an audit event in the host telemetry stream, and restores the last known valid state. All persistence write operations must execute via temporary shadow files with atomic replacement semantics to protect against sudden process termination or system brownouts.

### Acceptance Card 41.06: wasteland grave epitaphs player presentation

**Source and ownership:** Pure domain logic resides in `Assets/Ashfall.Core/Memorial/MemorialSystem.cs`; authored data ingested from `Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/wasteland_grave_epitaphs.json`. Host composition wires through `src/Host/MemorialHostSession.cs`. All persistent state writes through `memorial_records section in campaign save`.
**Feature acceptance:** Exposes wasteland_grave_epitaphs.json on burial tombstones inspectable by player in shelter cemetery.
**Fresh campaign:** When starting a fresh campaign on day 1, memorial memory acts initializes with valid baseline parameters without missing reference exceptions or unassigned collections. All state structures populate cleanly from authoritative JSON templates.
**Repeat and idempotency:** Invoking operations multiple times under identical inputs produces stable state without unintended accumulation, memory leakage, or double-application of deltas. Command dispatchers reject redundant duplicate invocations safely.
**Save and restore:** Round-trip serialization into `memorial_records section in campaign save` preserves complete data fidelity. Deserializing saved state restores all parameters, counters, active timers, and entity links bit-for-bit, producing matching state checksums across reloads.
**Invalid reference safety:** If an invalid, corrupted, or uncataloged identifier is supplied, `Assets/Ashfall.Core/Memorial/MemorialSystem.cs` rejects the operation with a typed domain refusal code. Execution remains completely safe without NullReferenceException or unhandled aborts.
**Day/order boundary:** Advancing campaign days via `CampaignDayCoordinator` processes time-dependent decays, resets, and transitions in strict deterministic sequence. Day transitions maintain absolute temporal consistency regardless of whether tick processing occurs during active gameplay or batch catch-up. Order-of-operations hazards between dependent modules are eliminated through explicit priority staging, guaranteeing reproducible outcomes across headless and interactive sessions.
**Player surface:** User interfaces and presentation nodes reflect real-time domain facts without introducing local caching discrepancies. Modifying values in Core immediately triggers UI update events. Input commands routed from UI panels pass full boundary validation before reaching domain logic. Controllers and keyboard navigation maintain reliable focus rings, legible contrast, and robust escape pathways under all viewport configurations.
**Cross-owner consequence:** Cross-subsystem side effects execute strictly through established delegate seams. When an action influences external domains (such as needs, inventory, narrative, audio, or weather), the command is dispatched once through the authoritative interface. No secondary state copies or parallel ledgers are stored locally. Receiving subsystems retain full sovereignty over their internal validation and state mutations.
**Determinism and bounds:** Replaying identical operational sequences with fixed RNG seeds yields bit-for-bit identical state outcomes. Numeric calculations utilize strict integer, basis-point, or clamped floating-point arithmetic with bounded ranges to eliminate floating-point drift across platforms. Boundary clamps strictly prevent underflow or overflow, and calculations never draw from unseeded system clocks or non-deterministic hash codes.
**Focused selection:** Verified exclusively via `Ashfall.Core.Tests/Shelter/Plan40_41DebtRoomIntegrationTests.cs`. All test assertions validate explicit domain invariants, boundary conditions, edge cases, and regression locks. New cases must test concrete behavioral contracts rather than trivial getter/setter mechanics, guaranteeing that production defects are trapped during automated CI gates.
**Deep domain and implementation analysis:** For the integration case `wasteland grave epitaphs player presentation`, the implementation team must verify that `memorial memory acts` logic maintains strict transactional boundaries. Specifically, when state changes occur, all associated entity references must be validated against the active catalog registries. If an entity is undergoing concurrent mutation, the coordinator locks the state pipeline, completes the transaction atomically, and broadcasts an immutable fact record. In headless regression runs, the execution path must exhibit zero variance across repeated iterations. The underlying memory structures must avoid unnecessary heap allocations, prioritizing struct-based telemetry events and pooled collection buffers. In addition, user-facing error reporting must surface structured failure tokens rather than unstructured strings, ensuring complete internationalization compatibility across all supported Godot localization tables.

Numeric calculations utilize strict integer, basis-point, or clamped floating-point arithmetic with bounded ranges to eliminate floating-point drift across platforms. Boundary clamps strictly prevent underflow or overflow, and calculations never draw from unseeded system clocks or non-deterministic hash codes.
**Focused selection:** Verified exclusively via `Ashfall.Core.Tests/Shelter/Plan40_41DebtRoomIntegrationTests.cs`. All test assertions validate explicit domain invariants, boundary conditions, edge cases, and regression locks. New cases must test concrete behavioral contracts rather than trivial getter/setter mechanics, guaranteeing that production defects are trapped during automated CI gates.
**Deep domain and implementation analysis:** For the integration case `personal belongings recovery from death site`, the implementation team must verify that `memorial memory acts` logic maintains strict transactional boundaries. Specifically, when state changes occur, all associated entity references must be validated against the active catalog registries. If an entity is undergoing concurrent mutation, the coordinator locks the state pipeline, completes the transaction atomically, and broadcasts an immutable fact record. In headless regression runs, the execution path must exhibit zero variance across repeated iterations. The underlying memory structures must avoid unnecessary heap allocations, prioritizing struct-based telemetry events and pooled collection buffers. In addition, user-facing error reporting must surface structured failure tokens rather than unstructured strings, ensuring complete internationalization compatibility across all supported Godot localization tables. Furthermore, edge cases involving depleted resources, maximum capacity thresholds, rapid user input spam, and mid-tick session pauses must be exercised thoroughly in the test suite to guarantee that no unhandled state divergence can destabilize the overarching survival simulation.
**Failure mode mitigations and resilience guarantees:** In scenarios where external dependencies experience transient failure or invalid configurations, `personal belongings recovery from death site` executes an isolated fallback protocol. Rather than allowing corrupt data to propagate into primary campaign ledgers, the coordinator marks the transaction as aborted, records an audit event in the host telemetry stream, and restores the last known valid state. All persistence write operations must execute via temporary shadow files with atomic replacement semantics to protect against sudden process termination or system brownouts.

**Day/order boundary:** Advancing campaign days via `CampaignDayCoordinator` processes time-dependent decays, resets, and transitions in strict deterministic sequence. Day transitions maintain absolute temporal consistency regardless of whether tick processing occurs during active gameplay or batch catch-up. Order-of-operations hazards between dependent modules are eliminated through explicit priority staging, guaranteeing reproducible outcomes across headless and interactive sessions.
**Player surface:** User interfaces and presentation nodes reflect real-time domain facts without introducing local caching discrepancies. Modifying values in Core immediately triggers UI update events. Input commands routed from UI panels pass full boundary validation before reaching domain logic. Controllers and keyboard navigation maintain reliable focus rings, legible contrast, and robust escape pathways under all viewport configurations.
**Cross-owner consequence:** Cross-subsystem side effects execute strictly through established delegate seams. When an action influences external domains (such as needs, inventory, narrative, audio, or weather), the command is dispatched once through the authoritative interface. No secondary state copies or parallel ledgers are stored locally. Receiving subsystems retain full sovereignty over their internal validation and state mutations.
**Determinism and bounds:** Replaying identical operational sequences with fixed RNG seeds yields bit-for-bit identical state outcomes. Numeric calculations utilize strict integer, basis-point, or clamped floating-point arithmetic with bounded ranges to eliminate floating-point drift across platforms. Boundary clamps strictly prevent underflow or overflow, and calculations never draw from unseeded system clocks or non-deterministic hash codes.
**Focused selection:** Verified exclusively via `Ashfall.Core.Tests/Shelter/Plan40_41DebtRoomIntegrationTests.cs`. All test assertions validate explicit domain invariants, boundary conditions, edge cases, and regression locks. New cases must test concrete behavioral contracts rather than trivial getter/setter mechanics, guaranteeing that production defects are trapped during automated CI gates.
**Deep domain and implementation analysis:** For the integration case `memorial monument crafting and dedication`, the implementation team must verify that `memorial memory acts` logic maintains strict transactional boundaries. Specifically, when state changes occur, all associated entity references must be validated against the active catalog registries. If an entity is undergoing concurrent mutation, the coordinator locks the state pipeline, completes the transaction atomically, and broadcasts an immutable fact record. In headless regression runs, the execution path must exhibit zero variance across repeated iterations. The underlying memory structures must avoid unnecessary heap allocations, prioritizing struct-based telemetry events and pooled collection buffers. In addition, user-facing error reporting must surface structured failure tokens rather than unstructured strings, ensuring complete internationalization compatibility across all supported Godot localization tables. Furthermore, edge cases involving depleted resources, maximum capacity thresholds, rapid user input spam, and mid-tick session pauses must be exercised thoroughly in the test suite to guarantee that no unhandled state divergence can destabilize the overarching survival simulation.
**Failure mode mitigations and resilience guarantees:** In scenarios where external dependencies experience transient failure or invalid configurations, `memorial monument crafting and dedication` executes an isolated fallback protocol. Rather than allowing corrupt data to propagate into primary campaign ledgers, the coordinator marks the transaction as aborted, records an audit event in the host telemetry stream, and restores the last known valid state. All persistence write operations must execute via temporary shadow files with atomic replacement semantics to protect against sudden process termination or system brownouts.

All persistence write operations must execute via temporary shadow files with atomic replacement semantics to protect against sudden process termination or system brownouts.

### Acceptance Card 41.29: survivor will and testament asset redistribution

**Source and ownership:** Pure domain logic resides in `Assets/Ashfall.Core/Memorial/MemorialSystem.cs`; authored data ingested from `Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/wasteland_grave_epitaphs.json`. Host composition wires through `src/Host/MemorialHostSession.cs`. All persistent state writes through `memorial_records section in campaign save`.
**Feature acceptance:** Deceased survivors distribute accumulated scrap, rations, and bedding according to authored wills.
**Fresh campaign:** When starting a fresh campaign on day 1, memorial memory acts initializes with valid baseline parameters without missing reference exceptions or unassigned collections. All state structures populate cleanly from authoritative JSON templates.
**Repeat and idempotency:** Invoking operations multiple times under identical inputs produces stable state without unintended accumulation, memory leakage, or double-application of deltas. Command dispatchers reject redundant duplicate invocations safely.
**Save and restore:** Round-trip serialization into `memorial_records section in campaign save` preserves complete data fidelity. Deserializing saved state restores all parameters, counters, active timers, and entity links bit-for-bit, producing matching state checksums across reloads.
**Invalid reference safety:** If an invalid, corrupted, or uncataloged identifier is supplied, `Assets/Ashfall.Core/Memorial/MemorialSystem.cs` rejects the operation with a typed domain refusal code. Execution remains completely safe without NullReferenceException or unhandled aborts.
**Day/order boundary:** Advancing campaign days via `CampaignDayCoordinator` processes time-dependent decays, resets, and transitions in strict deterministic sequence. Day transitions maintain absolute temporal consistency regardless of whether tick processing occurs during active gameplay or batch catch-up. Order-of-operations hazards between dependent modules are eliminated through explicit priority staging, guaranteeing reproducible outcomes across headless and interactive sessions.
**Player surface:** User interfaces and presentation nodes reflect real-time domain facts without introducing local caching discrepancies. Modifying values in Core immediately triggers UI update events. Input commands routed from UI panels pass full boundary validation before reaching domain logic. Controllers and keyboard navigation maintain reliable focus rings, legible contrast, and robust escape pathways under all viewport configurations.
**Cross-owner consequence:** Cross-subsystem side effects execute strictly through established delegate seams. When an action influences external domains (such as needs, inventory, narrative, audio, or weather), the command is dispatched once through the authoritative interface. No secondary state copies or parallel ledgers are stored locally. Receiving subsystems retain full sovereignty over their internal validation and state mutations.
**Determinism and bounds:** Replaying identical operational sequences with fixed RNG seeds yields bit-for-bit identical state outcomes. Numeric calculations utilize strict integer, basis-point, or clamped floating-point arithmetic with bounded ranges to eliminate floating-point drift across platforms. Boundary clamps strictly prevent underflow or overflow, and calculations never draw from unseeded system clocks or non-deterministic hash codes.
**Focused selection:** Verified exclusively via `Ashfall.Core.Tests/Shelter/Plan40_41DebtRoomIntegrationTests.cs`. All test assertions validate explicit domain invariants, boundary conditions, edge cases, and regression locks. New cases must test concrete behavioral contracts rather than trivial getter/setter mechanics, guaranteeing that production defects are trapped during automated CI gates.
**Deep domain and implementation analysis:** For the integration case `survivor will and testament asset redistribution`, the implementation team must verify that `memorial memory acts` logic maintains strict transactional boundaries. Specifically, when state changes occur, all associated entity references must be validated against the active catalog registries. If an entity is undergoing concurrent mutation, the coordinator locks the state pipeline, completes the transaction atomically, and broadcasts an immutable fact record. In headless regression runs, the execution path must exhibit zero variance across repeated iterations. The underlying memory structures must avoid unnecessary heap allocations, prioritizing struct-based telemetry events and pooled collection buffers. In addition, user-facing error reporting must surface structured failure tokens rather than unstructured strings, ensuring complete internationalization compatibility across all supported Godot localization tables. Furthermore, edge cases involving depleted resources, maximum capacity thresholds, rapid user input spam, and mid-tick session pauses must be exercised thoroughly in the test suite to guarantee that no unhandled state divergence can destabilize the overarching survival simulation.
**Failure mode mitigations and resilience guarantees:** In scenarios where external dependencies experience transient failure or invalid configurations, `survivor will and testament asset redistribution` executes an isolated fallback protocol. Rather than allowing corrupt data to propagate into primary campaign ledgers, the coordinator marks the transaction as aborted, records an audit event in the host telemetry stream, and restores the last known valid state. All persistence write operations must execute via temporary shadow files with atomic replacement semantics to protect against sudden process termination or system brownouts.
