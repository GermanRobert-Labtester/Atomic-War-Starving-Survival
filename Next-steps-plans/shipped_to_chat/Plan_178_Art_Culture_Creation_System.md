# Plan 178 — Art & Culture Creation — Canonical Vault Composition

## Current-evidence architecture decision (2026-09-24; supersedes stale instructions below)

This section is the operative integration architecture for **Art and culture creation**. It is a plan, not an implementation claim. The baseline material below remains a scenario inventory; when it says a missing file is “new,” requests a separate registry, or assumes a host count, this current-evidence section controls. Current source was inspected on 2026-09-24. Recheck it at the start of a claimed implementation package because concurrent integration work may have moved the seams.

**Verified premise:** Core, host, Main commands, a save section, and a CLI selftest now exist. The worktree has an ACTIVE claim covering integration files, so this plan is a future handoff and must be refreshed after that claim closes. Do not create an ArtCreationSystem or another archive store.

**Master authority mapping:** C9 survivor interiority, C17 UI, C13 chronicle. The master expansion document `docs/newest-ashfall-master-expansion-authority-v2-0-complete-compiled-edition-volumes-1-57.md` supplies the Part II premise sweep, evidence labels, anti-duplication firewall, and Lane A prose, Lane B mechanics, Lane D save, and Lane E player-surface questions. Its scene and content candidates are ideas, not evidence that a route currently works. The live source and AGENTS.md take precedence.

**Bounded outcome:** Establish one source fact or player command, one canonical consumer, one durable result, and one truthful player readout for the next unsealed gap. The first phase should close a single representative path. A later content batch, cross-system extension, or balancing pass is a separate path claim. Creation state stays with CultureCreationSystem; archive and journal are projections.

### Authority and custody map

| Concern | Custody | Required proof before a change |
|---|---|---|
| Domain rule | `Assets/Ashfall.Core/Culture/CultureCreationSystem.cs` | Inspect public API, mutation and capture/restore; amend it only for an observed gap. |
| Producer | `a player creation command with valid creator, medium, theme, day, and seeded RNG` | Show that the event follows a committed action and carries stable IDs/day. |
| Host composition | `src/Host/CultureCreationHostSession.cs and src/Main.CultureCreation.cs` | Show setup, restore, bind, dirty/save, reset and lifecycle order in the current tree. |
| Destination effect | `CultureCreationSystem and the existing journal/archive projection` | Call its existing command once; do not mirror its state in this plan. |
| Persistence | `culture_creation section through CultureCreationSaveStore` | Save both source marker and effect custody; prove retry cannot duplicate. |
| Player readout | `a proposed culture display command/view that reads the host census` | Display provenance, current status, next command and refusal using existing state. |

### Phase gates

0. **Claim and recensus.** Read `INTEGRATION_PLANS.md`, `WORKTREE_OWNERSHIP.md`, `TEST_POLICY.md`, `KNOWN_DEBT.md`, the current domain owner, the specific host route, save registration and catalog loader. Record the exact files a builder may edit. If a current active claim overlaps, wait for its handoff. If source contradicts this page, amend this page before coding.
1. **Domain fact.** Pick one case from the scenario inventory below. Specify input identity, accepted preconditions, typed result, mutation owner, idempotency key and failure code. A UI callback cannot decide domain legality. If an existing owner already supplies the effect, use it and retire the proposed duplicate.
2. **Catalog and prose.** Inspect the actual JSON row shape and consumer. Add only reachable rows with unique IDs and valid references. Write concise diegetic text for a real state and a separate refusal. A copy field is never a source of numeric gameplay rules. The master’s Lane A archetype may suggest tone, but the current loader sets field limits.
3. **Save and deterministic replay.** Identify the exact save DTO and section. Capture after the authoritative mutation, restore before event rebinding, and replay the same input. Use the campaign RNG fork only where the current owner already consumes it; no wall clock, hash-order sampling or process-local dedupe. Treat missing old fields as the documented baseline and reject malformed new values before they enter live state.
4. **Host composition.** Bind the producer to `CultureCreationSystem and the existing journal/archive projection` in the existing host lifetime. Respect setup order, reset, dirty tracking, save orchestration, and unsubscription. If a consumer is optional, specify the withheld effect and a truthful unavailable reason; do not silently report success. Shared `Main` and registry files belong to the named integrator.
5. **Presentation.** Bind `a proposed culture display command/view that reads the host census` to a read model and command result. Render stable IDs as authored labels only after validating a lookup. Keep keyboard/controller focus, close/back, refresh and disposal correct; expose reasons in words, not color alone. Do not let opening a panel trigger a milestone, trade, or consequence.
6. **Focused acceptance and handoff.** Select the smallest directly relevant test file under `TEST_POLICY.md` when implementation is authorized. Prove fresh path, repeated input, save/restore boundary, invalid reference, headless host route if touched, and UI projection if touched. Record exact commands and results. This document edit does not run implementation tests.

### Code integration framework: current API anchors and proposed placement

**Verified call anchor:** `Main.CreateArtwork` calls `CultureCreationHostSession.CreateArtwork` with a `culture_creation` RNG fork, then journals the result; `DisplayArtwork` already exists.

The following C# fragment identifies an existing method and its intended position in the current host. It is a placement guide, not a new authority type or a copy-and-paste patch. Variables and refusal types come from the owning method. A builder must open that source file and reconcile the exact signature in Phase 0.

```csharp
var session = EnsureCultureCreation();
var rng = _campaignDay?.Rng.Fork("culture_creation") ?? new SeededRng(178);
ArtworkRecord record = session.CreateArtwork(
    creatorSurvivorId, title, medium, theme, _simDay, artistSkill, rng);
// Existing SaveCultureCreation captures through CultureCreationSaveStore.
// Archive/vault projection must consume record identity once.
```

**Source contract.** Accept a fact only after the owning command commits. Carry its stable ID, subject, campaign day and authored row ID through the host boundary. Distinguish a query from a mutation: `Evaluate` may mutate counters in some current Core systems, so call sites must be inspected instead of assuming the method name is pure. A panel asks for a read model; a player command asks the existing host session to validate and commit. Treat a missing subject or catalog row as a refusal before changing any destination owner.

**Destination contract.** The destination owner alone changes CultureCreationSystem and the existing journal/archive projection. The host carries a typed fact or uses the owner’s established delegate; it does not copy the destination value into another mutable store. The implementation review must record method name, input ID and before/after destination state. If the destination lacks a safe command, record an authority decision rather than writing its fields directly. A projected outcome is useful only if it can be traced back to the original committed fact.

**Save and retry contract.** Capture culture_creation section through CultureCreationSaveStore after mutation and before reporting a durable result. Where two owners persist separately, the handoff must name save order and recovery for a crash between writes. A repeated fact ID after restore must be a no-op or resume one pending effect, depending on the current owner’s marker semantics. No process-local boolean can stand in for persisted applied identity. The old-save baseline should be documented with one fixture and a stable outcome; corruption should fail without partially mutating an unrelated section.

**Host lifecycle contract.** Reconstruct Core state first, then attach the producer subscription once, then expose a player surface. Reset detaches handlers and clears only transient references. Dirty tracking must follow actual state change; calling a query must not mark a section dirty unless the inspected Core method genuinely updates counters. The shared `Main` and save registry remain integrator-owned paths. The review note should include setup, save, reset and direct/indirect caller locations.

**Focused implementation specimen.** Arrange a valid source ID and a real catalog row; invoke the command or event through the current host; assert destination state and readout; capture and restore into a new session; replay the same ID; assert there is still one effect. In a second fixture, substitute the invalid reference described in the relevant casebook and assert a specific refusal with no resource, standing, stage, or wallet change. This is the minimum evidence for one vertical slice, not a request to generate a separate test for every card.

**Content handoff.** Author a short observation, a command label, a refusal, and a consequence line only in fields actually consumed by the current UI or event renderer. Use existing localization and accessibility conventions. A passage must not announce an unlock, treatment, route, or economic result before its owner confirms the state. The narrative writer receives stable IDs and the exact before/after facts, so a line of prose can be reviewed against an implementation trace.

### Integration architecture closeout criteria

The *planning* architecture is finished when each proposed effect names its producer, rule owner, destination owner, host attachment, save carrier, player readout, duplicate guard, negative path, and focused proof. Runtime integration is finished only when those paths are implemented and the relevant focused checks pass. This distinction applies to every scenario below. The handoff must name any decision gate and must not upgrade a proposal to “shipped” because a Core class or catalog row exists.

## Earlier scenario inventory and intent (subject to the current-evidence architecture above)


> Integration plan revision: 2026-09-24. Source of truth: current repository source and data, then
AGENTS.md, then
[docs/newest-ashfall-master-expansion-authority-v2-0-complete-compiled-edition-volumes-1-57.md](../docs/newest-ashfall-master-expansion-authority-v2-0-complete-compiled-edition-volumes-1-57.md).
This document is a planning artifact. It does not claim paths or authorize a competing implementation
package.

## 1. Objective and bounded outcome

Reconcile the existing artwork record with the signed vault/hobby/decor authority map, then implement a
single real creation command whose output reaches an existing consumer and survives its approved save
lineage.

**Earlier audit state (superseded):** CultureCreationSystem and six art forms existed with capture/restore; the current host and Main bindings are identified above. The signed 178/190 authority map proposes creation through existing
vault/hobby/decor interfaces and forbids a second archive save; its statement that ArtCreationSystem is
absent does not erase the differently named CultureCreationSystem. Numeric Main.Plans178_181 is child
development, not art.

**Non-goals:** No second art engine, duplicate vault recording, standalone art save section without an
ownership decision, imaginary inventory item, decoration bonus applied twice, or inert art-form catalog
route.

**First deliverable:** a signed authority/custody disposition and exact path claim. A read-only projection
may proceed after its owners agree; any mutable integration needs a separate approved vertical slice and
save/reload evidence.

## 2. Authority and evidence status

The current or candidate domain authority is `CultureCreationSystem currently holds artwork records;
CulturalArchiveVaultSystem, SurvivorDowntimeSystem and ShelterDecorSystem own adjacent outcomes`. Source and
adjacent paths inspected for this revision (some are candidate consumers rather than active bindings):
`Assets/Ashfall.Core/Culture/CultureCreationSystem.cs`, `src/Main.FlagshipInstitutions.cs`,
`src/Main.Plans178_181.cs`, `docs/culture/PLAN_178_190_CREATION_LORE_AUTHORITY_MAP.md`,
`src/UI/ArchiveDeskPanel.cs`, and `Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/art_forms.json`. The focused test starting
point is `Ashfall.Core.Tests/Culture/CultureCreationSystemTests.cs`. Persistence boundary under audit:
`culture_creation is registered for artwork; cultural_archives remains the vault owner`.
Paths are evidence pointers, not advance claims.
The master expansion authority v2.0 supplies the planning discipline and continuity map: C9 interiority, C1
decor, C16 progression and C17 panels; the master points to the signed 178/190 lore authority map and
demands that item identity, archive content, and creation records remain distinct. Its Part II requires live
premise checks, bounded subject scope, explicit evidence labels, and a duplication firewall. The relevant
deep maps and lane matrices guide coverage; they do not override newer code. The master compilation itself
warns against padding and stale repository assumptions. This plan therefore records concrete contracts and
treats older task lists as intent pending current verification.

## 3. Current contract and collision firewall

- **Evidence or explicit premise:** CultureCreationSystem.LoadCatalog reads art_forms, but CreateArtwork
  accepts an ArtMedium directly and does not check form_id, required_skill, required_materials, or
  creation_time_days.
- **Evidence or explicit premise:** CreateArtwork uses optional ISeededRng, produces art_{sequence}
  identity, quality and masterwork, updates cultural identity, and emits events.
- **Evidence or explicit premise:** DisplayArtwork mutates only the local ArtworkRecord.DisplayLocation;
  GetShelterCultureMoraleBonus computes a capped projection, and the current host consumer needs a fresh call-site review.
- **Evidence or explicit premise:** The older audit found no host reference; the current tree has Main/Host references and a culture_creation section.
- **Evidence or explicit premise:** The signed docs/culture/PLAN_178_190_CREATION_LORE_AUTHORITY_MAP.md owns
  the 178/190 boundary: creation may append to vault recordings/chronicles or hobby output; second archive
  save is OUT.
- **Evidence or explicit premise:** ArchiveDeskPanel is an adjacent surface, not evidence of an art command;
  an implementation must select a reachable current player route.

### Culture creation authority dossier

The signed 178/190 map is a required premise. It says a player creation command should append to the
`CulturalArchiveVaultSystem` or a hobby output and should not create a second archive section. The Core
`CultureCreationSystem` exists under a different name than the map's absent `ArtCreationSystem`; its artwork
records contain creator, title, medium, theme, day, quality, display location, and identity. This is a
genuine ownership collision. The foreman must choose whether the record is a bounded creation
transaction/projection within vault custody, or whether there is an explicitly separate artwork authority
with a justified persistence section. The current host save wiring exists; future archive effects still require the signed custody decision and an exact claimed path.

The `art_forms.json` fields imply skill, materials, duration, morale, value, and placement rules, but the
current `CreateArtwork` method does not consume a `form_id` or any of those prerequisites. A concrete
command should choose one form row, read canonical skill and inventory, reserve/commit costs atomically,
honor duration through an existing work/job owner if approved, and produce one record. If that design
exceeds the signed authority, limit the first slice to an instantaneous, no-cost vault entry and state the
reduced scope honestly.

Artwork display is currently only a string field. A decor owner must verify a location exists and is
available; then a local display pointer may be updated. The morale projection is at most 15 in Core, but
another morale system must own the actual survivor/shelter effect. Prove whether the bonus is a live query,
reversible mark, or one-time event; do not add both a daily bonus and a creation event for the same work.

The first reviewable outcome is one art form → one canonical creator command → one vault chronicle/recording
→ reload → truthful surface. Masterworks and cultural identity follow only once a stable artifact identity
and custody are established.

Before code edits, inspect existing equivalent producers and consumers with `rg`, read their public methods
and save snapshots, and write a one-page premise note. If another live owner already mutates the target
concern, use it. If a required write API does not exist, return the proposed consumer hook to the foreman as
an authority decision. Do not create a side ledger to bypass that missing API.

## 4. Ownership matrix

| Concern | Current or proposed owner | Implementation rule |
|---|---|---|
| authored definitions | `Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/art_forms.json` | Validate schema, IDs, references and finite ranges before use. |
| source fact | `Assets/Ashfall.Core/Culture/CultureCreationSystem.cs` | Keep domain invariants in Core; source emits a typed fact. |
| host composition | `src/Main.FlagshipInstitutions.cs` | Wire only current owners and lifetime-safe event subscriptions. |
| campaign save | `culture_creation is registered for artwork; cultural_archives remains the vault owner` | Use the existing section or seek an explicit section decision if none exists. |
| player view | `src/UI/ArchiveDeskPanel.cs` | Render current state, blockers and effects without gameplay mutation. |
| cross-system effect | `destination subsystem named in each phase` | Call the owner method once; do not copy its mutable state. |

## 5. Data and identity contract

Canonical IDs come from the existing catalogs and runtime facts. Case handling, trimming and comparison must
match the owning system. Proposed new IDs need a schema and reference validator before a producer can emit
them. Read the current JSON fields before extending a row; do not use the old plan’s desired row count as an
acceptance measure. Reject duplicates or conflicting definitions with per-row diagnostics. Treat display
names and prose as presentation, never identity. Preserve ordinal ordering for stable output and save
checksum inputs.
A change to catalog shape requires an old-catalog compatibility rule, one example valid row, one invalid
row, and a reader inventory. New prose must state a real observed consequence; it cannot promise trade,
safety, quest or reward behavior until a consumer reads the corresponding Core fact. Avoid real-world names
or copied narrative.

## 6. C# implementation sketch

```csharp
// Decision-gated composition sketch, not an approved new save path.
ArtworkRecord artwork = creation.CreateArtwork(creatorId, title, medium, theme, day, skill, rng);
// Commit the approved archive/vault output through CulturalArchiveVaultSystem.
// A display command asks ShelterDecorSystem to accept a location; then
// CultureCreationSystem.DisplayArtwork records the accepted placement.
// If the vault rejects, do not leave an orphaned artwork or spent materials.
```

The snippet shows ownership and call direction, not a paste-ready replacement. The implementing agent must
confirm names and signatures against the live tree immediately before coding. Keep `Assets/Ashfall.Core/`
free of Godot and Unity references. If an adapter needs a callback, bind it in the current host lifetime,
unsubscribe on disposal, and keep domain decisions in Core.

## 7. State, save and migration

Inspect `docs/culture/PLAN_178_190_CREATION_LORE_AUTHORITY_MAP.md` and the registry for the named concern;
absence of a section is a decision gate, not permission to invent one. Write down exact DTO version,
constructor baseline, capture point, restore point, and dirty flag. For a stateless bridge, persist only the
source and destination authorities; do not create a bridge section. If a new mutable field is genuinely
required, version the existing owner DTO and prove migration from the preceding schema. Never equate a panel
cache with campaign state.
The restore sequence is: catalog validated; source state restored; destination state restored; adapters
bound; pending effects reconciled once; UI bound; day processing resumes. A new campaign starts with an
explicit empty/default state. A legacy save without the field takes that same baseline without inventing
past events. Unknown future schema versions must fail or degrade according to the existing save contract,
with a visible diagnostic. Corrupt single records must not silently reset an entire unrelated section.

## 8. Event, day and failure semantics

One semantic fact should carry stable source ID, campaign day, owning entity ID, content ID if any, and
enough context for the destination owner to decide. The host may route the fact but may not calculate a
competing gameplay rule. Define when the fact is emitted, when a command is committed, and what is durable
before the next callback. A read-only query must not create journal entries or rewards on every panel
refresh.
Use the canonical day owner only for behavior that genuinely changes with time. Preserve the current day
phase ordering and forked seeded RNG contract. No wall-clock seed, hash-order iteration, or System.Random
belongs in deterministic Core. Replay after load must not repeat a completed effect; an effect that was not
committed must remain recoverable. When a destination owner rejects a command, keep the source fact and show
a reason rather than writing a partial substitute effect.

## 9. Player commands and UI

Inspect the current route to `src/UI/ArchiveDeskPanel.cs` and its bind/open/close methods. Expose only
commands backed by an existing Core method or a specifically planned method in the named owner. The panel
should show source state, currently legal action, expected cost, blocker, committed outcome, and uncertainty
where the game cannot know more. Refresh on authoritative state change and after restore; unbind
subscriptions on close/disposal. Preserve keyboard/controller back and readable contrast.

## 10. Dependency-ordered implementation phases

### Phase 0 — Premise and claim

**Action:** Read current source/data; diff the old plan against delivered work; claim exact paths before an
edit. **Gate:** A signed package lists files, owner, non-goals, acceptance and focused command.
**Dependency:** Phase 0 requires a claim; later phases require the preceding gate. Shared composition roots
remain integrator-owned; if a phase needs them, package the exact seam for the integrator.

### Phase 1 — Core/consumer contract

**Action:** Identify one producer fact and one destination owner. Add the smallest typed query or command if
the owner agrees. **Gate:** A domain unit exercise proves input, refusal, and stable identity.
**Dependency:** Phase 0 requires a claim; later phases require the preceding gate. Shared composition roots
remain integrator-owned; if a phase needs them, package the exact seam for the integrator.

### Phase 2 — Data validation

**Action:** Extend only the existing catalog as required by Phase 1; validate references and ranges.
**Gate:** One valid and one invalid row produce clear, reproducible results. **Dependency:** Phase 0
requires a claim; later phases require the preceding gate. Shared composition roots remain integrator-owned;
if a phase needs them, package the exact seam for the integrator.

### Phase 3 — Save and restore

**Action:** Bind existing section; introduce versioned state only for genuinely new durable facts. **Gate:**
Round-trip, old-save baseline, and replay-after-restore agree. **Dependency:** Phase 0 requires a claim;
later phases require the preceding gate. Shared composition roots remain integrator-owned; if a phase needs
them, package the exact seam for the integrator.

### Phase 4 — Host composition

**Action:** Bind in the current session at correct setup order, route result to destination owner once.
**Gate:** A focused host-level check observes the real destination effect. **Dependency:** Phase 0 requires
a claim; later phases require the preceding gate. Shared composition roots remain integrator-owned; if a
phase needs them, package the exact seam for the integrator.

### Phase 5 — UI and narrative

**Action:** Bind existing panel or claimed route to a read model; show action and blocker truthfully.
**Gate:** A headless or bounded runtime check opens/refreshes/closes without a stale claim. **Dependency:**
Phase 0 requires a claim; later phases require the preceding gate. Shared composition roots remain
integrator-owned; if a phase needs them, package the exact seam for the integrator.

### Phase 6 — Acceptance and handoff

**Action:** Run only directly affected focused test files and necessary runtime probe. **Gate:** Handoff
includes exact commands/results, limitations, and shared paths untouched. **Dependency:** Phase 0 requires a
claim; later phases require the preceding gate. Shared composition roots remain integrator-owned; if a phase
needs them, package the exact seam for the integrator.

## 11. File impact map

| Path | Action after claim | Reason | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Assets/Ashfall.Core/Culture/CultureCreationSystem.cs` | READ / bounded MODIFY | domain contract | medium |
| `Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/art_forms.json` | READ / bounded MODIFY | authored rules | medium |
| `src/Main.FlagshipInstitutions.cs` | READ / bounded MODIFY | session wiring | high |
| `src/Main.Plans178_181.cs` | READ / integrator MODIFY | composition root | high |
| `docs/culture/PLAN_178_190_CREATION_LORE_AUTHORITY_MAP.md` | READ / bounded MODIFY | persistence | high |
| `src/UI/ArchiveDeskPanel.cs` | READ / bounded MODIFY | truthful surface | medium |
| `Ashfall.Core.Tests/Culture/CultureCreationSystemTests.cs` | READ / focused MODIFY | contract verification | low |

No paths in this table are claimed by this document. At implementation time compare them with
`WORKTREE_OWNERSHIP.md` and assign the exact package. Do not edit a currently claimed path.

## 12. Focused acceptance and rollback

Use `bash scripts/run_test.sh Ashfall.Core.Tests/Culture/CultureCreationSystemTests.cs` for the first
contract check, then only the directly affected save and host targets identified by Phase 0. Run a Godot
headless probe only if the claimed change affects the runtime host path. A compile result cannot establish
live route reachability. Acceptance requires: (1) one real input; (2) one canonical consumer effect; (3) one
durable restore; (4) repeat delivery without duplicate effect; (5) visible correct state and blocker; (6) no
new authority.
Keep changes in reviewable phase commits. If a consumer hook fails, revert that phase without replacing the
canonical owner; preserve old saves and catalog compatibility. If a migrated section cannot load, stop
before adding UI or content and give the integrator the exact schema and fixture. Record any deferred edge
with a current evidence pointer and promotion condition rather than claiming it complete.

## 13. Detailed integration acceptance cards

The following cards are planning checks, not a request to create one test method per card. Each card has one
feature-specific expected outcome; crosscutting checks below it define the evidence needed to accept that
outcome. Select the smallest independent cases that prove the changed contract, save/load, determinism,
lifecycle, and cross-system behavior. “Legacy intent” cards are explicitly conditional: first prove their
premise and owner, then either promote as a separate bounded package or mark them retired. This prevents the
2026-09-01 plan text from resurrecting already delivered or contradictory architecture.

### 01. painting art form [CURRENT ACCEPTANCE SCENARIO — VERIFY EFFECT]

**Source and ownership:** This card concerns painting art form. Start from
`Assets/Ashfall.Core/Culture/CultureCreationSystem.cs` and `Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/art_forms.json` and
trace any effect through `src/Main.FlagshipInstitutions.cs` to its current destination owner. Persistence
must follow this boundary: `culture_creation section registered for artwork; cultural_archives owns vault state`. Verify the exact source and destination sections; a new section
requires an ownership decision. Keep the source fact distinct from the consumer mutation. Catalog evidence:
No catalog row directly matches this integration case; verify the current producer and destination API
before implementation.

**Feature-specific acceptance:** form_painting must resolve its catalog row; any skill/material/time rule is
a proposed command requirement, not a behavior of current CreateArtwork.

**Fresh campaign path.** For painting art form, Start a new seeded campaign with the smallest legal source
fact. Invoke the current owner through its normal host entry point, then inspect the projected outcome at
the intended consumer. State the exact identifier and day in the focused fixture. The card passes only when
the named destination read model or canonical command has the expected result; otherwise record a bounded
dependency. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination state
field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Repeat and idempotency.** For painting art form, Deliver the same source fact twice, including a retry
after a UI refresh or host rebind. The owner must use its existing stable ID or an explicitly designed
applied marker so the consumer mutation and player notification occur once. Do not solve duplication by a
process-local boolean that disappears on reload. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable
ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Save and restore.** For painting art form, Capture the relevant existing section after the source fact and
before the player views it. Restore into a fresh host/session and compare domain state, consumer state, and
visible text. Repeat with the save taken immediately before the consumer effect to prove the recovery path
has an explicit pending/completed contract. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID,
source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Invalid reference.** For painting art form, Replace one referenced catalog ID with an unresolved value in
an isolated fixture. The data validator should report the authored error; runtime must refuse that one
effect or show a specific unavailable reason. It must not invent a fallback faction, location, survivor,
item, quest, or animal. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day,
destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Day/order boundary.** For painting art form, Exercise the same fact at day 1, at the relevant threshold,
and after a later day tick. Run setup in both legal host orders if the dependency may initialize lazily. The
final state must follow canonical campaign day and deterministic ordering, with no callback registered
twice. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination state field or
read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Player surface.** For painting art form, Open the existing panel before and after the effect and after
reloading. The panel reads a Core or host read model, displays the actual blocker and outcome, and preserves
close/back/focus behavior. A label that announces a benefit absent from the owning system fails this card.
Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination state field or read
model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Cross-owner consequence.** For painting art form, Trace the fact from producer to destination authority.
Show the precise command/query on the destination owner, the one save section it already uses, and a visible
downstream difference. If no such command exists, record the need as a named integration dependency rather
than writing state into the producer. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source
day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Determinism and bounds.** For painting art form, Replay identical seed, content and ordered facts in two
fresh runs; compare the existing section state and consumer read model. Clamp only at the owner that defines
the allowed range. If this card needs randomness, fork from the existing campaign stream and make the event
key stable. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination state
field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Focused selection:** Reuse `Ashfall.Core.Tests/Culture/CultureCreationSystemTests.cs` if it covers this
contract. Add a case only for a new public, save, lifecycle, mutation, deterministic, or cross-owner
behavior. Record this card as passed, deferred with an owner, or stale with source evidence; do not leave an
ambiguous “implemented” label.

### 02. sculpture art form [CURRENT ACCEPTANCE SCENARIO — VERIFY EFFECT]

**Source and ownership:** This card concerns sculpture art form. Start from
`Assets/Ashfall.Core/Culture/CultureCreationSystem.cs` and `Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/art_forms.json` and
trace any effect through `src/Main.FlagshipInstitutions.cs` to its current destination owner. Persistence
must follow this boundary: `culture_creation section registered for artwork; cultural_archives owns vault state`. Verify the exact source and destination sections; a new section
requires an ownership decision. Keep the source fact distinct from the consumer mutation. Catalog evidence:
No catalog row directly matches this integration case; verify the current producer and destination API
before implementation.

**Feature-specific acceptance:** form_sculpture may create one artwork only after an approved material
consumption and archive destination are named.

**Fresh campaign path.** For sculpture art form, Start a new seeded campaign with the smallest legal source
fact. Invoke the current owner through its normal host entry point, then inspect the projected outcome at
the intended consumer. State the exact identifier and day in the focused fixture. The card passes only when
the named destination read model or canonical command has the expected result; otherwise record a bounded
dependency. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination state
field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Repeat and idempotency.** For sculpture art form, Deliver the same source fact twice, including a retry
after a UI refresh or host rebind. The owner must use its existing stable ID or an explicitly designed
applied marker so the consumer mutation and player notification occur once. Do not solve duplication by a
process-local boolean that disappears on reload. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable
ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Save and restore.** For sculpture art form, Capture the relevant existing section after the source fact
and before the player views it. Restore into a fresh host/session and compare domain state, consumer state,
and visible text. Repeat with the save taken immediately before the consumer effect to prove the recovery
path has an explicit pending/completed contract. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable
ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Invalid reference.** For sculpture art form, Replace one referenced catalog ID with an unresolved value in
an isolated fixture. The data validator should report the authored error; runtime must refuse that one
effect or show a specific unavailable reason. It must not invent a fallback faction, location, survivor,
item, quest, or animal. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day,
destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Day/order boundary.** For sculpture art form, Exercise the same fact at day 1, at the relevant threshold,
and after a later day tick. Run setup in both legal host orders if the dependency may initialize lazily. The
final state must follow canonical campaign day and deterministic ordering, with no callback registered
twice. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination state field or
read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Player surface.** For sculpture art form, Open the existing panel before and after the effect and after
reloading. The panel reads a Core or host read model, displays the actual blocker and outcome, and preserves
close/back/focus behavior. A label that announces a benefit absent from the owning system fails this card.
Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination state field or read
model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Cross-owner consequence.** For sculpture art form, Trace the fact from producer to destination authority.
Show the precise command/query on the destination owner, the one save section it already uses, and a visible
downstream difference. If no such command exists, record the need as a named integration dependency rather
than writing state into the producer. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source
day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Determinism and bounds.** For sculpture art form, Replay identical seed, content and ordered facts in two
fresh runs; compare the existing section state and consumer read model. Clamp only at the owner that defines
the allowed range. If this card needs randomness, fork from the existing campaign stream and make the event
key stable. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination state
field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Focused selection:** Reuse `Ashfall.Core.Tests/Culture/CultureCreationSystemTests.cs` if it covers this
contract. Add a case only for a new public, save, lifecycle, mutation, deterministic, or cross-owner
behavior. Record this card as passed, deferred with an owner, or stale with source evidence; do not leave an
ambiguous “implemented” label.

### 03. music composition art form [CURRENT ACCEPTANCE SCENARIO — VERIFY EFFECT]

**Source and ownership:** This card concerns music composition art form. Start from
`Assets/Ashfall.Core/Culture/CultureCreationSystem.cs` and `Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/art_forms.json` and
trace any effect through `src/Main.FlagshipInstitutions.cs` to its current destination owner. Persistence
must follow this boundary: `culture_creation section registered for artwork; cultural_archives owns vault state`. Verify the exact source and destination sections; a new section
requires an ownership decision. Keep the source fact distinct from the consumer mutation. Catalog evidence:
No catalog row directly matches this integration case; verify the current producer and destination API
before implementation.

**Feature-specific acceptance:** form_music_composition needs a durable artifact or performance identity; do
not count an unplayed composition as a radio broadcast.

**Fresh campaign path.** For music composition art form, Start a new seeded campaign with the smallest legal
source fact. Invoke the current owner through its normal host entry point, then inspect the projected
outcome at the intended consumer. State the exact identifier and day in the focused fixture. The card passes
only when the named destination read model or canonical command has the expected result; otherwise record a
bounded dependency. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination
state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Repeat and idempotency.** For music composition art form, Deliver the same source fact twice, including a
retry after a UI refresh or host rebind. The owner must use its existing stable ID or an explicitly designed
applied marker so the consumer mutation and player notification occur once. Do not solve duplication by a
process-local boolean that disappears on reload. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable
ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Save and restore.** For music composition art form, Capture the relevant existing section after the source
fact and before the player views it. Restore into a fresh host/session and compare domain state, consumer
state, and visible text. Repeat with the save taken immediately before the consumer effect to prove the
recovery path has an explicit pending/completed contract. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method,
stable ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Invalid reference.** For music composition art form, Replace one referenced catalog ID with an unresolved
value in an isolated fixture. The data validator should report the authored error; runtime must refuse that
one effect or show a specific unavailable reason. It must not invent a fallback faction, location, survivor,
item, quest, or animal. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day,
destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Day/order boundary.** For music composition art form, Exercise the same fact at day 1, at the relevant

effect or show a specific unavailable reason. It must not invent a fallback faction, location, survivor,
item, quest, or animal. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day,
destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Day/order boundary.** For creation duration, Exercise the same fact at day 1, at the relevant threshold,
and after a later day tick. Run setup in both legal host orders if the dependency may initialize lazily. The
final state must follow canonical campaign day and deterministic ordering, with no callback registered
twice. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination state field or
read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Player surface.** For creation duration, Open the existing panel before and after the effect and after
reloading. The panel reads a Core or host read model, displays the actual blocker and outcome, and preserves
close/back/focus behavior. A label that announces a benefit absent from the owning system fails this card.
Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination state field or read
model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Cross-owner consequence.** For creation duration, Trace the fact from producer to destination authority.
Show the precise command/query on the destination owner, the one save section it already uses, and a visible
downstream difference. If no such command exists, record the need as a named integration dependency rather
than writing state into the producer. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source
day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Determinism and bounds.** For creation duration, Replay identical seed, content and ordered facts in two
fresh runs; compare the existing section state and consumer read model. Clamp only at the owner that defines
the allowed range. If this card needs randomness, fork from the existing campaign stream and make the event
key stable. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination state
field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Focused selection:** Reuse `Ashfall.Core.Tests/Culture/CultureCreationSystemTests.cs` if it covers this
contract. Add a case only for a new public, save, lifecycle, mutation, deterministic, or cross-owner
behavior. Record this card as passed, deferred with an owner, or stale with source evidence; do not leave an
ambiguous “implemented” label.

### 10. artist identity and day [CURRENT ACCEPTANCE SCENARIO — VERIFY EFFECT]

**Source and ownership:** This card concerns artist identity and day. Start from
`Assets/Ashfall.Core/Culture/CultureCreationSystem.cs` and `Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/art_forms.json` and
trace any effect through `src/Main.FlagshipInstitutions.cs` to its current destination owner. Persistence
must follow this boundary: `culture_creation section registered for artwork; cultural_archives owns vault state`. Verify the exact source and destination sections; a new section
requires an ownership decision. Keep the source fact distinct from the consumer mutation. Catalog evidence:
No catalog row directly matches this integration case; verify the current producer and destination API
before implementation.

**Feature-specific acceptance:** CreatorSurvivorId and CreationDay must come from the canonical roster and
campaign clock; reject unknown or departed creators per signed rule.

**Fresh campaign path.** For artist identity and day, Start a new seeded campaign with the smallest legal
source fact. Invoke the current owner through its normal host entry point, then inspect the projected
outcome at the intended consumer. State the exact identifier and day in the focused fixture. The card passes
only when the named destination read model or canonical command has the expected result; otherwise record a
bounded dependency. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination
state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Repeat and idempotency.** For artist identity and day, Deliver the same source fact twice, including a
retry after a UI refresh or host rebind. The owner must use its existing stable ID or an explicitly designed
applied marker so the consumer mutation and player notification occur once. Do not solve duplication by a
process-local boolean that disappears on reload. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable
ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Save and restore.** For artist identity and day, Capture the relevant existing section after the source
fact and before the player views it. Restore into a fresh host/session and compare domain state, consumer
state, and visible text. Repeat with the save taken immediately before the consumer effect to prove the
recovery path has an explicit pending/completed contract. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method,
stable ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Invalid reference.** For artist identity and day, Replace one referenced catalog ID with an unresolved
value in an isolated fixture. The data validator should report the authored error; runtime must refuse that
one effect or show a specific unavailable reason. It must not invent a fallback faction, location, survivor,
item, quest, or animal. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day,
destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

fact. Invoke the current owner through its normal host entry point, then inspect the projected outcome at
the intended consumer. State the exact identifier and day in the focused fixture. The card passes only when
the named destination read model or canonical command has the expected result; otherwise record a bounded
dependency. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination state

### 12. seeded quality and masterwork [CURRENT ACCEPTANCE SCENARIO — VERIFY EFFECT]

**Source and ownership:** This card concerns seeded quality and masterwork. Start from
`Assets/Ashfall.Core/Culture/CultureCreationSystem.cs` and `Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/art_forms.json` and
trace any effect through `src/Main.FlagshipInstitutions.cs` to its current destination owner. Persistence
must follow this boundary: `culture_creation section registered for artwork; cultural_archives owns vault state`. Verify the exact source and destination sections; a new section
requires an ownership decision. Keep the source fact distinct from the consumer mutation. Catalog evidence:
No catalog row directly matches this integration case; verify the current producer and destination API
before implementation.

**Feature-specific acceptance:** For a fixed campaign RNG fork, QualityScore and IsMasterwork match after
replay; quality is not recomputed on restore.

**Fresh campaign path.** For seeded quality and masterwork, Start a new seeded campaign with the smallest
legal source fact. Invoke the current owner through its normal host entry point, then inspect the projected

ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Invalid reference.** For hobby output overlap, Replace one referenced catalog ID with an unresolved value
in an isolated fixture. The data validator should report the authored error; runtime must refuse that one
effect or show a specific unavailable reason. It must not invent a fallback faction, location, survivor,
item, quest, or animal. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day,
destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Day/order boundary.** For hobby output overlap, Exercise the same fact at day 1, at the relevant
threshold, and after a later day tick. Run setup in both legal host orders if the dependency may initialize
lazily. The final state must follow canonical campaign day and deterministic ordering, with no callback
registered twice. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination
state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Player surface.** For hobby output overlap, Open the existing panel before and after the effect and after
reloading. The panel reads a Core or host read model, displays the actual blocker and outcome, and preserves
close/back/focus behavior. A label that announces a benefit absent from the owning system fails this card.
Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination state field or read
model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Cross-owner consequence.** For hobby output overlap, Trace the fact from producer to destination
authority. Show the precise command/query on the destination owner, the one save section it already uses,
and a visible downstream difference. If no such command exists, record the need as a named integration
dependency rather than writing state into the producer. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method,
stable ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is
unavailable.

**Determinism and bounds.** For hobby output overlap, Replay identical seed, content and ordered facts in
two fresh runs; compare the existing section state and consumer read model. Clamp only at the owner that
defines the allowed range. If this card needs randomness, fork from the existing campaign stream and make
the event key stable. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination
state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Focused selection:** Reuse `Ashfall.Core.Tests/Culture/CultureCreationSystemTests.cs` if it covers this
contract. Add a case only for a new public, save, lifecycle, mutation, deterministic, or cross-owner
behavior. Record this card as passed, deferred with an owner, or stale with source evidence; do not leave an
ambiguous “implemented” label.

### 17. decoration placement legality [CURRENT ACCEPTANCE SCENARIO — VERIFY EFFECT]

**Source and ownership:** This card concerns decoration placement legality. Start from
`Assets/Ashfall.Core/Culture/CultureCreationSystem.cs` and `Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/art_forms.json` and
trace any effect through `src/Main.FlagshipInstitutions.cs` to its current destination owner. Persistence
must follow this boundary: `culture_creation section registered for artwork; cultural_archives owns vault state`. Verify the exact source and destination sections; a new section
requires an ownership decision. Keep the source fact distinct from the consumer mutation. Catalog evidence:
No catalog row directly matches this integration case; verify the current producer and destination API
before implementation.

**Feature-specific acceptance:** DisplayArtwork should run only after ShelterDecorSystem accepts a real
location and must clear/move the old placement consistently.

**Fresh campaign path.** For decoration placement legality, Start a new seeded campaign with the smallest
legal source fact. Invoke the current owner through its normal host entry point, then inspect the projected
outcome at the intended consumer. State the exact identifier and day in the focused fixture. The card passes
only when the named destination read model or canonical command has the expected result; otherwise record a
bounded dependency. Acceptance evidence should name the actual method, stable ID, source day, destination
state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Repeat and idempotency.** For decoration placement legality, Deliver the same source fact twice, including
a retry after a UI refresh or host rebind. The owner must use its existing stable ID or an explicitly
designed applied marker so the consumer mutation and player notification occur once. Do not solve
duplication by a process-local boolean that disappears on reload. Acceptance evidence should name the actual
method, stable ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the
operation is unavailable.

**Save and restore.** For decoration placement legality, Capture the relevant existing section after the
source fact and before the player views it. Restore into a fresh host/session and compare domain state,
consumer state, and visible text. Repeat with the save taken immediately before the consumer effect to prove
the recovery path has an explicit pending/completed contract. Acceptance evidence should name the actual
method, stable ID, source day, destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the
operation is unavailable.

**Invalid reference.** For decoration placement legality, Replace one referenced catalog ID with an

### 18. shelter morale projection [CURRENT ACCEPTANCE SCENARIO — VERIFY EFFECT]

**Source and ownership:** This card concerns shelter morale projection. Start from
`Assets/Ashfall.Core/Culture/CultureCreationSystem.cs` and `Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/art_forms.json` and
trace any effect through `src/Main.FlagshipInstitutions.cs` to its current destination owner. Persistence
must follow this boundary: `culture_creation section registered for artwork; cultural_archives owns vault state`. Verify the exact source and destination sections; a new section
requires an ownership decision. Keep the source fact distinct from the consumer mutation. Catalog evidence:
No catalog row directly matches this integration case; verify the current producer and destination API
before implementation.

**Feature-specific acceptance:** GetShelterCultureMoraleBonus is capped at 15; prove a canonical morale
consumer reads it once and reverses it on undisplay.

**Fresh campaign path.** For shelter morale projection, Start a new seeded campaign with the smallest legal
source fact. Invoke the current owner through its normal host entry point, then inspect the projected
outcome at the intended consumer. State the exact identifier and day in the focused fixture. The card passes
only when the named destination read model or canonical command has the expected result; otherwise record a

### 19. artwork save custody [CURRENT ACCEPTANCE SCENARIO — VERIFY EFFECT]

**Source and ownership:** This card concerns artwork save custody. Start from
`Assets/Ashfall.Core/Culture/CultureCreationSystem.cs` and `Assets/StreamingAssets/Data/art_forms.json` and
trace any effect through `src/Main.FlagshipInstitutions.cs` to its current destination owner. Persistence
must follow this boundary: `culture_creation section registered for artwork; cultural_archives owns vault state`. Verify the exact source and destination sections; a new section
requires an ownership decision. Keep the source fact distinct from the consumer mutation. Catalog evidence:
No catalog row directly matches this integration case; verify the current producer and destination API
before implementation.

**Feature-specific acceptance:** No culture_creation save section is registered; obtain a signed custody
decision before adding host serialization.

**Fresh campaign path.** For artwork save custody, Start a new seeded campaign with the smallest legal
source fact. Invoke the current owner through its normal host entry point, then inspect the projected
outcome at the intended consumer. State the exact identifier and day in the focused fixture. The card passes

destination state field or read model, and exact refusal code if the operation is unavailable.

**Player surface.** For old-save empty artwork baseline, Open the existing panel before and after the effect
and after reloading. The panel reads a Core or host read model, displays the actual blocker and outcome, and

## 15. Handoff contract

**MUST PRESERVE:** one Core/domain owner per concern, current JSON authority, existing save lineage,
deterministic replay, and claimed-path discipline.

**MUST ADD:** only the scoped producer-to-consumer path and its observable result after the Phase 0 premise
audit.

**MUST NOT ADD:** a parallel registry, default fake facts, unowned UI mutation, duplicate resource, morale,
dose, archive, achievement, profile, or faction state, Unity dependency, or a full-suite gate for this
document edit.

**VERIFY WITH:** `bash scripts/run_test.sh Ashfall.Core.Tests/Culture/CultureCreationSystemTests.cs` plus
targeted owner save/host checks selected at claim time under `TEST_POLICY.md`.

**FIRST SAFE IMPLEMENTATION STEP:** publish a current premise note and exact path claim, then implement the
first accepted vertical slice. This plan does not itself alter production code.

## Integration casebooks: producer, custody, presentation, and failure

These casebooks turn the earlier scenario names into reviewable implementation questions. They are acceptance design, not claims that every feature already exists or that every case needs one test method. Select one bounded case per implementation package and record evidence before promoting it.

## Polishing pass and architecture handoff

This revision received a second editorial pass after the architecture and casebooks were assembled. The pass normalizes headings and whitespace, treats the current evidence section as authoritative over older speculative instructions, preserves the older scenario inventory as conditional intent, removes the most consequential false present-tense claims, and checks that every implementation phase has an owner, a save rule, a player route, a failure path, and a focused proof. Casebook prose is deliberately phrased as review work where a consumer or route has not been verified. The live-source recensus remains mandatory before implementation, especially where another active claim is changing a host.

**Closeout:** Plan 178 now has a documented integration architecture and a bounded first-slice method. No production behavior has been changed by this document. Runtime completion requires the claimed implementation package, focused verification, and the handoff described above.
